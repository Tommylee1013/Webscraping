Virtual Accelerator 
Abstract 
Our goal is to create the ideal innovation environment for startups by  utilising blockchain technology for the release of the Virtual Accelerator. 

========1========

Introduction   
“If you look at history, innovation doesn't come  just from giving people incentives; it comes  from creating environments where their ideas  can connect.” 
- Steven Johnson 
Year 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto started the Bitcoin project [Nakamoto 2009]. This frst  blockchain made possible a completely autonomous fnance system. 
Year 2014, a team of blockchain enthusiasts started project Ethereum, a revolutionary  technology making it possible to create essentially any type of autonomously directed  blockchain-based object. 
Year 2016, we are starting the Virtual Accelerator (VA) to provide transparent and true  acceleration to blockchain developers around the world. 
The technology of blockchain and smart contracts allows for transparent evaluation  and ranking via tokens that allow holders to refect their conviction for an idea for  development. 
Crowdfunding projects have become a popular method to raise funding at the early  stages of a project (Massolution [2015]), but generally the early backers don’t receive  anything more than the frst version of the product. 
A better approach is to enable those that identify the value in an initiative at the  beginning to evidence their conviction using units of uniform value. That’s what our  platform facilitates. 
The rights of early adopters who support an idea and project at the initial stages are  enforced by the Solidity [Reitwiessner 2015] smart contract deployed to the Ethereum  blockchain.

Ideas   
“If you can dream it,  you can do it.”  
- Walt Disney 
The seed of each successful company begins with an idea. The idea requires a team  of people to turn it into a prototype or MVP. A prototype needs user input from early  adopters to iterate and improve it until users are actually willing to pay for the features  they want. This is the path followed by many startups as they have become today’s  successful companies. The chain of success always starts with  an initial link of an  idea. 
The Virtual Accelerator registration opens months before the start of the event and we  encourage hackers to share their ideas publicly. A well explained idea is the best way  to get other people passionate and ask to join your team. 
<ether.camp> 

========3========

Hackers 
“Every child is an artist. The problem is how to  remain an artist once we grow up.” 
- Pablo Picasso 
The Virtual Accelerator is a platform that allows for the presentation, testing and  launch of ideas. It’s a place that fosters new startups. 
The frst step is to build a team. We encourage people to use the platform to fnd  teammates based on mutual interests, shared values and complementary skill sets. 
Once a team is in place, and the vision for the project is clear, the next step is to attract  early adopters. These are people who will try out the prototype, express interest in the  product and commit to the future roadmap. 
Attracting early adopters is important as it proves to the development team that  they’re on the right track. 
What’s unique about the <hack.ether.camp> platform is that early adopters can also  be turned into kickstart backers and fund the project using the tokenizing feature  available 
to each startup team. (See Early Adopters section for more) 
The platform provides an open stage for teams to display and share their work,  allowing the whole community to see how they’re progressing while getting honest  feedback from a panel of experienced judges on their progress and direction. 
<ether.camp> 

========4========

Judges    
“The more original a discovery, the more   obvious it seems afterwards.” 
- Arthur Koestler 
As the event provides the potential for great ideas and projects to fourish and  materialise, we have invited a broad range of judges from various industries and  disciplines to provide feedback and direction to the teams. 
The judges are there to help provide the teams with motivation, with their votes  indicating that a team is making the right decisions. 
• 
Each judge has a total of 1000 kudos which they can award across various teams.  Voting will commence one week after the event has started. 
• 
Regular fans also have the right to vote and are provided with 10 kudos to issue to  the team or teams they see with the most potential. 
Fans can also increase the amount of kudos they have by providing proof of their  identity via their Facebook and / or Twitter account. 100 additional kudos votes are  provided for each account added. Overall a fan can therefore have a total of 210  kudos. 
• 
Voting on the blockchain is supported by a smart contract ProjectKudos and  described in details in the [Smart Contract Description] appendix.

Hacker Gold 
"Money never starts an idea; it is the idea that  starts the money." 
- William J. Cameron 
Hacker Gold (HKG) is the offcial token of the Virtual Accelerator. HKG allows anyone  to be involved and signify their appreciation of the best projects participating in the  event. 
HKG allows you to acquire tokens initiated by the individual startups during the  incubation period of the hackathon. Having these tokens, in turn, provides you with  preferred voting rights on the way that funds are used to develop the applicable  startup’s idea. Startups’ tokens issued after the hackathon do not come with preferred  voting rights. 
The amount of HKG collected by an individual team is a de facto crowd expression  of the perceived potential of the project. As such, it provides a baseline for future  crowdfunding by the team once the hackathon is over. The teams who collect the  most HKG will have the largest acceptance by the crowd and will have a clear signal of  the strength of their potential. 
• 
For the duration of the hackathon tokens initiated by startups will be listed on the  virtual exchange that forms part of the <hack.ether.camp> platform and can be  purchased using HKG. 
The only way to gain preferred voting rights on a startup’s development is to buy  tokens initiated by that startup during the hackathon event. 
• 
The emission process. HKG will be available for 9 weeks, starting from 4 weeks  before the hackathon starts and ending after the 5 weeks of the event are  complete. 
<ether.camp> 

========6========

Hacker Gold 
The price during the emission will be calculated like this: 
• 
P1:  Week 1-2: (200 HKG) for 1 Ether. 
• 
P2:  Week 2-4: (200 HKG - 150 HKG) for 1 Ether.  
The actual formula when X is the day in P2 : (200 - (X * 3.5)) HKG for 1 Ether    
• 
P3:  Week 5-6: (150 HKG) for 1 Ether  
• 
P4:  Week 7-9: (150 HKG - 100 HKG) for  1 Ether.  
The actual formula when X is the day in P4 : (150 - (X * 3.5)) HKG for 1 Ether 
No Premine. 
There is no special amount reserved for anyone.   
No Second Emission. 
HKG will only be available for purchase one time, closing at the end of the second  hackathon (December 2016) event. There will be no second sale. When the Virtual  Accelerator opens to new entrants through future hackathons the only way to  purchase HKG will be on the open market. 
<ether.camp> 

========7========

Hacker Gold 
HKG trading on exchanges. 
HKG is expected to be available for open trading on leading altcoin exchanges after  the <hack.ether. camp> event ends. 
Collected coins:  
The HKG token will refect the success of the Virtual Accelerator, with the ongoing  success of the platform in identifying breakout development teams and ideas  increasing the desire of developer and fans to hold the HKG token. 
The Virtual Accelerator platform presented at the time of releasing the white paper is  the 2nd generation version, the 1st generation version of the hackathon platform can  be seen here: 
http://season-1.ether.camp  
The Future  
Development on the Virtual Accelerator platform will be ongoing with updated  versions being released periodically. Our goal is to scale the platform and have  frequent competitions, generating more ideas, establishing new teams and forming  new startups. 
Our mission is to democratise opportunity for everyone, from opening access to  entrepreneurs to early funding for development through to providing a way for  developers and fans in the community to support other startups’ ideas. 
The ongoing development and marketing of the Virtual Accelerator will be funded from  the sale of HKG. 
<ether.camp>

BlockChain  Presence 
"It's really hard to design products by focus  groups.  A lot of times, people don't know what  they want until you show it to them."  
- Steve Jobs 
The team involved in each startup will have a self-enforcing smart contract that will  guarantee the rights of each person that acquires the tokens initiated by the startup.  This is achieved via the DSTContract, where DST stands for Decentralised Startup  Team. 
In this section we will provide an overview of the different aspects of the contract, for  the technical description please refer to the [Smart Contracts Description] appendix. 
Token offer 
The startup is an group of developers looking to fund their project’s R&D activities.  A fundamental aspect of the contract is holding the actual funds collected from the  community. There are 2 stages of fund collection: 
• 
Offering tokens during the period of the hackathon. The DST will receive the HKG  token in exchange for the particular token a team is offering. 
• 
After the hackathon event is over. The DST can receive Ether in exchange for the  particular token a team is offering. 
You will fnd more on the tokens value and rest of the funding discussed in [Post  Accelerator Period]. 
<ether.camp> 

========9========

BlockChain  Presence 
Executive Team 
This is the core startup team, who have come together to implement an idea that  they all believe in. Teams will vary depending on what they are trying to achieve, but  generally it will be a mix of skills e.g. a lead programmer, UI designer and system  administrator, would be a classic team that could build any prototype for a software  project. 
The primary obligation of the team is to drive forward the implementation of the  project. An important factor in this is how to allocate funds to make tangible progress.  Whether the executive team is one person or more, to move the startup forward it  will need to propose how it uses its funds. The ability to do this lies solely with the  executive team as it is responsible for the success or failure of the project. 
Early Adopters 
The adopters are more than just the people who test the initial versions of a product;  they’re actually real world validation that the project will have users. The valuable  contribution of early adopters is rewarded by providing them with voting rights. 
<ether.camp> 

========10========

BlockChain  Presence 
Voting rights 
Creating a balance between the right of early adopters to infuence the direction of a  startup, against the agility of the executive team to make funding decisions is key. To  allow for this, early adopters will not be asked to approve a proposal but only to refuse  a proposal they object to. 
If the executive team presents a proposal to spend X% of the funds, the funds will be  made available after 10 days unless 55% of the votes held by the early adopters object  to the transfer of the funds from the DSTContract. 
   
Impeachment process. 
In extreme cases if Early Adopters are not completely happy with what the executive  team is doing they can vote to change the executive team personnel. An impeachment  requires 70% of the voter rights. 
The most likely use case in this instance is to return funds. They can appoint a person  who will be responsible for returning the funds according to the share of each involved  person. 
<ether.camp> 

========11========

Post Accelerator  Period  
“The three great essentials to achieve anything  worthwhile are, frst, hard work; second, stick- to-itiveness; third, common sense.” 
- Thomas A. Edison 
• 
After the incubation period of the event, the startups continue to evolve their  prototype product into a functioning business by developing more features and  presenting the user base with a product roadmap. 
• 
It’s important to state that <ether.camp> is not claiming any rights over the  startups coming out from the Virtual Accelerator. The blockchain presence of the  startups is completely under the control of their executive team. 
• 
The startup will be allowed to initiate 5X more tokens immediately after the event  is over. Where X is the number of tokens sold during the hackathon event. The  tokens will be available to the general public directly for Ether. Tokens purchased in  the second phase of the crowdfund will not come with preferred voting rights. 
• 
The voting rights that early adopters have been given for HKG tokens acquired  during the Virtual Accelerator will grant some control over the spending of funds  and in very extreme cases changing the executive leaders. [see Blockchain  Presence section] 
• 
Collected HKG volatility - Startups can exchange their HKG tokens for leading  cryptocurrencies whether that is Ether or Bitcoin. This process will be made  gradual to encourage startups to continue their own kickstarter process, promoting  the remainder of their tokens for sale. 
The HKG volatility of the tokens will be structured as follows:  
• 
2 months after the event is fnished, 50% of the HKG amount will be released. 
• 
3rd month will be linear monotonic release of the last 50% of the HKG tokens:  0.03 * 0.5 * (HKG collected). 
<ether.camp> 

========12========

Project Kudos   
“If you don't know, the thing to do is not to  get scared, but to learn.”  
- Ayn Rand 
The voting system is a key aspect of the Virtual Accelerator. The platform’s smart  contract system, built on the Ethereum blockchain, allows the community and judges  to best recognise teams achievements. The team with the most kudos at the end of  the competition will win the frst placed prize. 
Voting will open one week after the event has started. 
Each person can give a portion of their kudos quota to one or more projects. The  actual voting is done by a blockchain transaction signed with the person's identity so  that it’s transparent and traceable. 
Each vote given to a project is therefore recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and will  be irreversible. 
Each registered individual starts with 10 kudos. Users who provide their identity  through Facebook and / or Twitter will receive an additional 100 kudos for each  account. The addition of both accounts will therefore provide a total of 210 kudos.  To reduce the potential for fraud a minimum 100 Facebook friends and 100 Twitter  followers are required. 
The details of smart contract: ProjectKudos are described in the [Smart Contract  Description] appendix.

KIBO IS A DECENTRALIZED LOTTERY BASED ON ETHEREUM SMART CONTRACTS 
This document describes the technical implementation of a system  based on smart contracts and important aspects regarding the 
promotion and market launch of the system 
KIBO Whitepaper

1. INTRODUCTION 
Today, lottery is the largest social and entertainment game in the world. The share  of lotteries on the world’s gambling market is over 30 %. The annual turnover of  this market today is $284 billion. Along with the penetration of the Internet and  the growing number of devices connected to a network, the number of users who  prefer playing this game online is growing. Consequently, the online lottery market  today is promising area.  
But despite such popularity, the lotteries currently present on the market cannot  provide the user with a 100 % guarantee of an honest lottery or offer full transparen- cy with regard to the formation and distribution of the prize fund. It is not surprising  that this issue is a hot topic for discussion on forums and in private conversations  among amateurs who like try their fortune in this game. Unfortunately, at present  one can see licensed operators periodically caught in various sorts of violations re- garding prize fund distribution and the honesty of the lottery. Just as important are  the conditions for receiving awards, which also have a number of shortcomings in  the form of delayed payments and various kinds of commissions. 
Now, thanks to smart contracts, we have the ability to address these critical issues.  KIBO is a decentralized lottery, the main advantage of which is the complete trans- parency of all processes taking place on the platform and the fundamental absence  of opportunities for fraud. Unlike “fair play checks”, which allow one to check game  results in existing cryptocurrency lotteries, KIBO itself eliminates the potential for  fraud. This is made possible by Ethereum and the concept of smart contracts. The  marketing component of the lottery is also implemented based on smart contracts,  allowing franchise partners and owners of KIBIT tokens to be sure of receiving their  earnings and the correctness of its calculation.  
KIBO is a platform where all processes are implemented and managed by smart  contracts. Ticket purchase, random number generation, and prize payouts, as well  as accruals in the distributed partner network, are performed by a smart contract  without the possibility of intervention by third parties.   Changes in the platform are  made by a vote of control token holders

ETHEREUM AS THE BASIS FOR IMPLEMENTATION 
For implementation of the project, the Ethereum [2] decentralized network, which  uses the concept of “smart contracts”, was chosen. Ethereum has great potential  for scaling [3] and the broad support of the cryptocommunity and investors. Cur- rently, the network is theoretically capable of handling about 10 transactions per  second; this is enough to start project implementation. 
Methods for network scaling presented in the above-mentioned report [3] will make  it possible to accept more than 50 million users in the near future. 
KIBO Whitepaper

========3========

2. The KIBO framework 
Currently, Ethereum infrastructure cannot yet offer a complete solution which in- cludes the decentralized part of the interface (the required functionality will appear  at the Metropolis stage. An excerpt from Ethereum’s offcial blog [5]: 
As it is not yet possible to decentralize the application interface itself at the mo- ment, the KIBO project is implemented partially in a server infrastructure which con- tains standard solutions for such cases, as well as a specialized application based  on smart contracts. In parallel with the work on the server solution, we are working  on various options for decentralizing the interface part, including our own solution. 
KIBO Whitepaper 
03 

========4========

3. The contract scheme. 
The KIBO Ethereum infrastructure is a set of contracts which interact with each  other according to the scheme below: 
At the initial stages of the platform’s work, contracts in the system can be replaced  (by the voting of control tokens, which at this stage are in the team of KIBO devel- opers). Upon completion of the test and development stages, the relations between  contracts will be recorded and subsequent changes in contracts and their relation- ships will not be possible. 
A. Managing contract 
The contract which coordinates the interaction of all other KIBO contracts, such  as lotteries or voting contracts. New user registration, lottery ticket purchases and  implementation of decisions adopted in a voting contract are performed by means  of referencing the managing contract. 
KIBO Whitepaper 
04 

========5========

B. Repository 
 repository contract is used to store data about users, franchisee partners and their  relationships. It should be noted that the contract only stores anonymous data that  are not linked to the user’s identity (the user is defned by his/her alias and wallet),  so any system user can be completely anonymous. 
Modifcation of certain data in the repository is only possible from the managing  contract; the central contract address is determined by voting of control token hold- ers. 
struct K_Users_User { 
uint shareholder; 
uint big; 
uint small; 
uint partner_type; 
string username; 
uint[8] partner_parents; 
uint[8] partner_parents_level; 
uint[8] player_parents; 
uint[8] player_parents_level;    
} 
// if user is shareholder  
// amount of kibits 2 user 
// if user is partner 
// 0 - new, 1 - registered before platform start // login 
// parents-partners structure for 7 levels // user have %q% partners at level of 7 
// parents-players structure for 7 levels // user have %q% players at level of 7 
C. Voting contract 
A contract that stores a list of issues for the management of all contracts, as well as  the conditions for making decisions on these issues. The voting and decision-mak- ing system is implemented such as to allow the development of the platform and  the addition of new games to KIBO’s functionality without the possibility of interven- tion in the algorithms for accrual and work with the customer base of the separate  branch of each partner. Only control token holders have the right to vote in this  contract. 
struct K_Ballot_Type { 
string theme; 
uint quorum; 
uint need; 
uint length; 
} 
//  issue text 
//  quorum for decision-making as a % //  % for decision-making //  voting duration (seconds) 
KIBO Whitepaper 
05 

========6========

4. Contract management 
Contract management is carried out by voting of control token holders. The list of  issues and the decision-making conditions for each of them is initially set in the  contract. Any control token holder can initiate voting on any issue in the list and  vote.  Voting results are accepted in the case of a positive vote of 30 % to 51 % of  control token holders, depending on the importance and impact on the subsequent  development and operation of the KIBO platform of the issue put to vote. 
To further stimulate voting activity, the following mechanism has been implement- ed: accrual of remuneration per token upon voting is carried out immediately after a  control token holder votes. The amount of remuneration for all 10,000 tokens is 1 %  of turnover from all platform lotteries. 
When tickets are purchased, funds are distributed as follows 
Branch bonus: 17% 
Payout on KIBITS: 14% 
Lottery prize fund: 68% 
Payout on control tokens: 1%

5. Tokens 
The KIBO platform has several different types of tokens, each of which has its own  set of features and an expanded incentive system. All Payouts and accruals of re- muneration in the branch network and all types of tokens are triggered when tickets  are purchased (this is the most frequent action in the system). Payouts of prizes to  players are also triggered by this and in one more way described below in the “Pay- out” section. All platform tokens are not KIBO internal currency and are not intended  for internal settlements in the system. All payouts and remunerations are made  directly to the user’s wallet in ETH cryptocurrency. 
KIBO control token  10,000 units are intended for contract management. It allows  one to put issues to a vote (voting contract) or vote on an issue. To further stimulate  voting activity, 1 % (in ETH cryptocurrency) from the total turnover of all lotteries  connected to the KIBO system is accrued to all 10,000 tokens. Accrual of remu- neration takes place at all times; however, the actual payout to the user’s wallet is  carried out only at the moment a control token holder votes. Thus, we strengthen  the motivation to vote, even for minority holders of control tokens. 
At the initial stage, control tokens will be distributed among the managing partners.  In the future, all or part of the control tokens may be distributed among a large num- ber of partners interested in the project’s development and growth. These are major  holders of KIBIT tokens or owners of platforms with large client bases. 
KIBO Whitepaper 
07 

========8========

This mechanism is incorporated in the smart contract algorithm in order to transfer  contract management to a decentralized basis in the future. 
KIBIT token:  The KIBO platform’s main investment asset. There are a total of 350  million tokens, to which 14 % of total turnover from all platform lotteries is accrued.  
As part of the marketing strategy, at the crowd-sale stage 100 million KIBIT tokens  will be distributed, to which 4 % of turnover will be allocated. The remaining 250 mil- lion are owned by the development team and will form the company’s income and  will be used at the team’s discretion, including for further platform development,  options within the team, and other strategic decisions.  
Tokens not sold during the sale remain under the control of the managing partners.  Income generated by these tokens may be 
sent to a specifc address by voting. 
KIBO PLATFORM token:  Allows one to become a KIBO branch owner and receive  the  respective  bonus  for  the  expansion  of  the  client  network  and  building  of  a  branch  network.  All  operations  and  payouts  of  remuneration  in  the  operation  of  KIBO branches are guaranteed by a smart contract. There a total of 20,000 base  (Kibo Platform) tokens 
The branch owner receives 10 % from all tickets purchased by clients invited by him  5 levels deep 
KIBO Whitepaper 
08 

========9========

Also,  the  KIBO  platform’s  functionality  incorporates  the  possibility  of  expanding  one’s own branch network by sending registration links and platform recommen- dations  at  the  time  of  the  crowdsale.  When  there  are  such  networks,  additional  accruals from each of these platforms will be 10 % from the income of all partner  branches up to the 7th level. 
Thus, 17 % will be paid out from the purchase of each ticket to stimulate the devel- opment of the client network and branch network. 10 % from ticket sales is paid out  to the client base owner, and 7 % is allocated among 7 levels upwards, 1 % each, for  payout to higher branches, which is equal to 10 % of the partner’s income at each  level.  
KIBO Whitepaper

========10========

6. Integrated marketing tool to promote continuous 
platform growth 
The user can participate in promotions and draws which are present on the KIBO  LOTTO platform. Any player can invite other players to the platform using his own  link and receive 5 % of the invited players’ winnings on a constant basis. This mech- anism is also managed by a smart contract and is part of a marketing strategy  called “game with friends”. Receipt of winnings from a game with friends is gov- erned by the following rules: 
To receive 5 % of the winnings of invited players:  
At level 1 you must have bought 1 ticket for this draw  At level 2 you must have bought 3 tickets for this draw At level 3 you must have bought 7 tickets for this draw 
Thus, the player is interested in inviting other players, because 
every invited person will greatly increase the chances of winning in each draw.  
Promotion 
An important marketing component embedded in the KIBO platform smart con- tract is the proper motivation of each client at all levels of development, both for  ordinary users and for the platform owners.  
In the promotional draws, which will continue for three months after the platform  launch, everyone can take part in a series of free draws with large cash prizes. This  promotion is aimed at expanding the client base of each branch and KIBO LOTTO  as a whole. Each player, as part of this promotion, will be able to give his friends the  opportunity to participate in this series of draws. The free tickets received by a play- er as a gift win only if 6 numbers are matched. As in the “Game with friends” mecha- nism, if a player at one of the three levels below another player wins, the latter player  receives 5 % of the amount won by the former player.  To obtain this bonus, it is not  necessary to buy tickets; the player needs only activate his free tickets for this draw.

Free ticket activation and protection against bots. 
To reduce the risk of possible bot attacks during free draws, free ticket activation  for a new player is carried out through balance refll in an amount of $1 or more.  After that, a restriction on cash withdrawal is set and funds in the amount of $1  cannot be withdrawn, but are at the user’s disposal. They are available for purchase  of tickets for participation in any paid draws that are held on the platform along with  the promotions. The user can withdraw any amount above $1 at any time. Once this  account has purchased 3 tickets on the platform, the restriction is automatically  removed, and from that point on the user can withdraw all the funds and zero out  the balance.  Thus, a bot attack becomes very costly and is comparable to simple  participation in the lottery, but for larger amounts. 
Prize fund formation and distribution. 
68 % of a ticket purchase is allocated to prize fund formation.  
Comments:  Since we have tickets from which payouts for the partner and client  bonus do not come entirely, as they fall within the area of non-distribution, there is  always a remainder. This remainder is always used to replenish the current draw  prize fund. This means that in fact the percentage used for prize fund formation is  different each time and is always greater than 68 %. Let us take the initial 68 % as  the basis for the description. These funds are intended for payouts related to the  lottery and distributed according to the reserve funds system within the contract as  follows 
KIBO Whitepaper 
11 

========12========

10% are deposited to the “reserve fund”, from which a guaranteed minimum jackpot  is formed for the next draw, if a jackpot is to be awarded in the current draw.   
13.5%  are used for the formation of a fund from which 5 % are paid three levels  upwards if a player with players above that invited him wins. Part of these funds will  not be spent each time after draw completion. For example, if a player who has only  one player above him wins. In this case, 10 % will not be paid to anyone. After each  draw, the unclaimed remainder from this fund is automatically sent to the “reserve  fund” of this lottery.  
76.5%  are used for the formation of the prize fund, from which the jackpot and oth - er prizes are formed. 
Next, 2 of the 4 lotteries presented on the platform at launch are 
described as an example. 
Lottery 6/49 
76.5 % of funds received for the formation of the prize payout fund in the lottery  6/49 are allocated as follows. 
First of all, 48 % goes towards jackpot formation. By directing the funds from a  purchased ticket to increase the jackpot frst of all, we always know the jackpot size  even before the draw and we can refect its increase in proportion with ticket sales.  Other prizes are formed after draw completion from the remaining 52 % as follows.   
Fixed prizes are calculated frst  
Tickets that guessed 2 main balls are frst. These players receive a prize in  an amount equal to the ticket price. 
Next, those who guessed 2 main balls + bonus ball receive their payout. The  amount of the payout is 1.7 times the ticket price. 
Next, those who guessed 3 main balls receive their payout. The amount of  the payout is 3 times the ticket price. 
The remaining funds are allocated among those who guessed 4 numbers or more  in the following order: 
4 main balls 57 % 
5 main balls + bonus ball 16 % 5 main balls 27 % 
KIBO Whitepaper 
12 

========13========

For example: 10 players guessed 5 balls; 27 % is allocated among them in equal  shares. 
Jackpot increase 
If in the current draw the jackpot is not won, the jackpot funds (48 %) go to increase  the next jackpot. That is, we take the 48 % and add them to the amount that is  allocated for the jackpot from the ticket sales for the next draw. Thus, the jackpot  continues to grow until it is won. Once the jackpot is won, the contract accesses  the reserve fund and withdraws the amount for the minimum guaranteed jackpot,  which increases from ticket sales according to the same scheme.  
General points   
A lottery contract is intended for conducting a lottery and storage of its draw results. Only the last 8 draws + the current draw are stored. 
To generate random numbers, a combination of several factors is used: 
Every time a ticket is purchased, the user transmits a random set of data   (automatically generated by frontend by default) 
After completion of the draw, the contract takes hashes of every other block  out of the 14 blocks after draw completion and mixes them with the ran- dom data from users.

JokerBall lottery 
In the JokerBall lottery, unlike in 6/49, the winning combination takes into account  not only the digit, but also its position in the number. The JACKPOT is fxed and is  allocated among the winners in the following way: 
Coincidence 
Prize 
2 
0.0003 % of the Jackpot per one ticket 
3 
0.0006 % of the Jackpot per one ticket 
4 
0.005 % of the Jackpot per one ticket 
5 
0.05% of the Jackpot per one ticket 
6 
2 % of the Jackpot per one ticket, but not more 
than 100 % 
7 
100 % of the Jackpot on all tickets 
Random number generation is similar to that for lottery 6/49. The lottery scheme is  also identical to that for lottery 6/49

7. Payout of winnings 
Due to the technical limitations of the ETHEREUM network at the moment, payouts  of winnings are made at the user’s request (a click on the button in the user inter- face next to the corresponding draw). 
Due to the fact that in order to make the payout, a large number of records in the  contract must be sorted (since payouts on some matches are made as a percent- age, that is, they depend on the number of people who guessed the given combina- tion), the payout is not made immediately, but only after sorting all the necessary  data. 
For one user’s payout request, 100 tickets are sorted; after all the tickets have been  sorted,  the actual payout to all users is launched by clicking the “payout” button  (100 payouts per click). Payouts are made only to those users who have clicked the  “payout” button.  
Thus, in order to complete sorting and payouts on all the tickets, one out of ffty  users who purchased a ticket needs to take his winnings. As the Ethereum network  scales up, the number of tickets sorted in a single operation will increase.

Primalbase: Distributed Workspace for Tech  
Community 
Amsterdam, May 2017 primal@primalbase.com www.primalbase.com 
Abstract. Building  upon  the  well-established  business  model  of  shared  workspaces,  the  Primalbase  project  transforms  traditional  office  rental  into  a  new-generation  community-based ecosystem where one can share, sell or  rent  out  high-quality  office  spaces  using  Ethereum  and  Waves-based  digital  tokens. Primalbase  tokens  not  only  serve  a  practical  function,  but  also  have  actual  inherent  value based on a real physical product: it is this that makes  Primalbase stand out from other projects utilizing crypto  tokens. The conception of the project and its core elements  are outlined in this paper. 
1. Introduction 
Real  estate  is  one  of  the  most  conservative  areas  of  the  economy,  while  Blockchain  is  considered  a  disruptive  and  novel  technology.  Nevertheless,  combining these seemingly incompatible elements has proved extremely fruitful  — a salient example being WeWork.  
The foundation of most co-working projects is the concept of creating a shared  infrastructure with a global community. The advantages of this business model  over  the  management  practices  of  large  corporations,  with  their  rigid  internal  regulations  and  strict  hierarchy,  are  quite  apparent.  This  is  especially  true  for  young  technological  start-ups,  who  are  increasingly  rejecting  the  traditional  office set up in favour of co-working environments. This format has gained much  traction:  according  to  2017  Global  Coworking  Survey,  the  number  of  new  coworking  projects  has  roughly  doubled  since  2011,  and  the  number  of  their  residents is estimated at 1.2 million (see also fig. 1). 

========1========

Fig. 1: Basic coworking spaces statistics, from Global Coworking survey 2017 
The number of successful co-working projects – most notably WeWork, Spaces  and Second Home – evidences the vitality and potential of this business model.  According to [1], «… the creative hub is more than the sum of its parts. It offers  creative micro businesses the chance to aggregate with others in order to access  crucial resources such as tools, specialist services, or inspiration to help develop  projects  and  businesses.  Hubs  represent  a  collective  approach  to  coping  with  uncertain social, cultural and economic environments and processes of creativity  and  innovation  …  Our  research  shows  that  creative  hubs  can  produce  a  wide  range  of  impacts  including  start-up  ventures,  jobs,  new  products  and  services,  future  investment  (public  and  commercial),  talent  development,  regional  talent  retention,  informal  education  and  engagement,  training,  urban  regeneration,  research  and  development,  new  networks,  innovative  models  of  organization,  quality of life enhancements and resilience». 
We  believe  that  the  use  of  crypto-tokens will  both  benefit  and  enhance  this  model: it was this notion that inspired the creation of this project. Through the  use of a single-payment crypto-token membership, the Primalbase project offers  access  to  all-inclusive  shared  workspaces  located  in  the  world’s  leading  tech  hubs. It’s scalable, fast to set up, and flexible in terms of timing and the size of  the team. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The first section will outline the  basic  concept  of  the  project  and  summarize  its  core  components.  The  second  section  is  devoted  to  explaining  the  token  system:  their  purpose,  the  pricing  mechanism and the transfer of ownership. The rules of the initial coin offering  (ICO)  campaign  will  also  be  charted  in  this  section.  The  legal  aspects  and  limitations  associated  with  this  project  will  be  discussed  in  the  final  sections.  Appendix  A  provides  a  summary  of  the  stack  of  Blockchain  technologies  that  will play a key role in the operation of the project. The accompanying software  architecture is schematically described in Appendix B. 

========2========

2. Concept 
The  project  will  be  executed  in  two  main  stages.  The  first  stage  is  the  establishment  of  five  shared  workspaces  in  the  following  strategic  locations:  Amsterdam, Berlin, London, New York and Singapore. Strategic in that, each is  regarded as one of the most beneficial cities for tech entrepreneurs. These spaces  will  be  up  to  2000  square  meters  in  size.  The  locations  of  future  Primalbase  workspaces will be decided by the vote of the Primalbase token holders (see also  paragraph 2.2). 
A  system  of  dividing  the  infrastructure  into  rentable  offices  (based  on  classic,  standard real estate relations) and non-rentable co-working spaces reserved only  for Primalbase community members (based on crypto-economic relations), will  ensure efficiency and profitability of Primalbase business model. Non-members  can obtain temporary membership and access to co-working spaces through the  renting of tokens from Primalbase community members. 
Although  ultimately,  the  underlying  profit  of  Primalbase  will  be  made  through  the renting of office space to companies, project teams, startups, branch offices,  etc. This will cover the operating expenses of the property management company. 
The cryptocurrency token Primalbase (PBT) is built on the WAVES platform and  is  compatible  with  Ethereum  protocols  (cf.  appendix  B).  There  is  a  proof-of- concept up and running in Amsterdam, which is already receiving endorsements  from prominent international tech entrepreneurs who have become members of  Primalbase's  growing  community.  In  accordance  with  the  business  model  outlined  above,  the  Amsterdam  unit  provides  shared  workspaces  to  the  current  members of the Primalbase community. 
To  develop  and  run  more  Primalbase  units  we  need  to  collect  funds  that  will  cover  start-up  costs,  the  operating  expenses  of  the  Property  Management  Company,  as  well  as  capital  expenditures  (building  the  offices  with  shared  workspaces in selected locations). To accomplish this task, the ICO procedure is  necessary.  
The  funds  collected  through  ICO  will  allow  us to  begin  the  creation  of  Primalbase infrastructures, adjust the first five units to the level of cost recovery,  and  ultimately  produce  the  revenue  to  be  re-invested  in  building  the  next  locations. The value of the tokens will surge as the demand continues to rise. 
Additionally,  the  tokenization  of  our  shared  workspaces  provides  us  with  a  unique  opportunity  to  establish  a  pool  of  committed  community  members,  tenants, landlords and opinion leaders, who we can rely on in the future stages of  the project’s development.

3. Token system 3.1 Purpose and functionality 
There are 3 main reasons for adopting the token system: 
§ 
§ 
§ 
It  is  a  means  of  raising  enough  money  to  develop  the  project.  Well- implemented  crowd  sales,  with  carefully  defined  objectives  and  guarantees, are one the best ways to both generate capital and to build a  community that has a stake in its success. 
The token represents a simple universal measure of the value of renting  membership from community members, the rising number of Primalbase  locations,  efficiency  of  the  shared  workspaces  model,  and  operating  profitability of the company. 
The  tokens  can  be  considered  as  an  investment  instrument  because  its  market value can significantly change as the project develops. 
To expand on that last point — opening hubs in new locations should lead to an  increase in our community membership, which in turn will allow us to establish  and secure new partnership agreements. The operating profit will also grow, as its  source is not the turnover of the tokens themselves, but the classical real estate  business model of subletting office space. This financial flow will enable us to  open several new hubs, which will lead to a further increase in the price of the  tokens — if only because each token will give access to an ever-increasing office  infrastructure. This process is depicted schematically on the figure below. 
Fig. 2: Diagram of token market price mechanics 
We emphasize that the Primalbase team cannot guarantee a monotonic increase in  the price of tokens and is not responsible for the possible losses associated with  such  speculative  use  of  tokens.  Access  to  all  Primalbase  hubs  services  and  functionality is guaranteed unconditionally on the current market price of a token. 

========4========

3.2 Token specification 
One  PBT  token  allows  full  access  to  the  shared  workspace  at  any  Primalbase  location  for  one  person.  In  every  office  space,  all  the  necessary  services  and  amenities will be present and provided, such as broadband Internet access, digital  printing, etc. The term of the token is unlimited and, therefore, does not expire.  The fee itself is secured in a single payment. The number of tokens that can be  purchased  by  the  same  holder  is  unlimited.  In  this  case,  the  possession  of  4  tokens permits the use of a private office, if one is available.  
As noted above, current tokens holders can participate in the further development  of the project: for example, to participate in the selection of future sites for new Primalbases, as decided by a general vote. Tokens are not bound to a person or  company, and anyone who can certify their ownership of it can use it. That is, the  token can be resold or leased on (see paragraph 2.3). 
PBT  tokens  are  divisible,  i.e.  their  number  need  not  be  an  integer.  Fractional  shares  are  introduced  for  the  convenience  of  working  with  PBT  as  investment  assets. The smallest fraction is 0.0001 PBT. It is worth noting that to access the  services of the hub the holder must have at least one complete token. 
We  assume  that  all  participants  in  the  project  will  maintain  a  proper  level  of  decorum, decency and ethical conduct. Therefore, the team reserves the right to  revoke  membership,  and  deny  access  to  Primalbase hubs  for  gross  or  repeated  violation of the rules of conduct. In this case, the current holder of the tokens can  only sell them. 
The  total  number  of  free-to-use  tokens  is  limited  to  1000.  Another  250  tokens  will be held in store for the social activities of the tech community, and will be at  the disposal of members of the advisory board.  
During the ICO, the payment can be made in any currency, both fiat and crypto;  in the case of the latter, it will be possible to use third party conversion services  like Kraken or Shapeshift. On the first day of ICO price of PBT will be equal to 3  Bitcoins (BTC), and from the second to the seventh day of ICO — to 4 BTC.  Starting from the eighth day the cost of the token will be 5 BTC.  
The  funds  raised  during  ICO  stage  will  be  kept  in  a  multi-signature  wallet  supervised by three members of the Advisory board. Funds are transparent and  will  be  spent  according  to  the  long-term  strategic  plan  (see  also  sec.  4);  an  approximate breakdown of raised funds is depicted on fig. 3 below.  
The ICO campaign will take place until the purchase of all 1000 tokens, but for  no longer than 1 month. If, not all the tokens are sold by the end of this period,  the unrealized balance will also be placed at the disposal of the board of directors.  Operations with tokens (sale, leasing, etc.) will be allowed only after the end of  the ICO campaign. 

========5========

Fig. 3: Approximate breakdown of funds spending 
As the project develops, part of the operating profit is expected to be spent on the  purchase  of  a  certain  number  of  tokens.  This  will  allow  the  reinvestment  of  revenue into the further development of the project — specifically, the opening of  new  hubs.  Moreover,  these  measures  will  partly  help  preserve  the  liquidity  of  PBT tokens at a level sufficient to make them an attractive investment medium. 
3.3 Token ownership  
Primalbase members  can  rent  or  sell  their  tokens  using  the  special  technical  feature of the underlying WAVES protocols. From a technical point of view, this  means that ownership of any amount of PBT can be transferred, temporarily or  permanently. These are peer-to-peer transactions; therefore, parties must agree on  costs and payments between themselves. 
The holder of the token is protected by his own Blockchain — the protocol works  in such a way that the token cannot be transferred on but remains in the wallet of  the rentee: in effect, the token is on a «temporary loan». The minimal duration  that a token can be rented is 3 months, and there is no maximum period. A rental  agreement may be terminated ahead of time by mutual decision of the parties or  unilaterally.  Formally,  the  WAVES  platform  does  not  allow  the  inclusion  of  specific leasing rules (i.e. the price, time, conditions, etc.) into the Blockchain, as  there can be too many scenarios of interaction between users. However, within  the leasing agreement between the parties, there are guarantees on the fulfillment  of contractual obligations of all involved. 
A token holder can sell as many tokens as they choose. However, any holder who  has  sold  all  their  tokens,  loses  the  right  to  access  the  co-working  services  provided. The innate features of Blockchain technologies make it impossible to  restore the ownership of tokens if the holder has, for whatever reason, lost his  private key. The responsibility to reliably store the private key is that of the token  holder alone.  

========6========

4. Legal aspects and issues 
Due  to  the  retrospective  nature  of  regulatory  action,  our  team  can  make  no  guarantees regarding the legality of the platform or launch of ICO campaign in  any given jurisdiction. PBT tokens are not securities and do not hold any rights in  the  company.  We  must  operate  our  business  in  accordance  with  the  laws  of  relevant jurisdictions. As such, PBT tokens may not be immediately available in  certain countries. 
The advisory board protects investors’ interests and provides the latter with all  the necessary reportage. The investor relations are built in a way like that of IPO  — based on quarterly investment reports. 
All legal aspects of real estate transactions — including, but not limited to, the  management and negotiation of rental contracts, the maintenance and surveillance  of buildings, and tax payments — will be coordinated by a central management  unit in the UK. 
5. Future development 
We intend to create larger scale and all-encompassing hubs at the most suitable  locations.  Developing  on  our  original  Primalbase  concept,  we  will  create  more  extensive  all-inclusive  venues  with  bars,  restaurants,  event  spaces  and  other  related facilities. A part of the profit made from these ventures will be distributed  among token holders. 
Based  on  business  tasks  and  received  feedback,  we  can  enhance  token  functionality  and  add  new  features.  The  modular  structure  of  chosen  digital  platform allows for further development and extension. 

========7========

Appendix A. Blockchain technologies 
Ledgers have been at the heart of commerce since ancient times and are used to  record  many  things,  most  commonly  assets  such  as  money  and  property.  Blockchain technology relies on the concept of distributed digital ledgers, which  are  essentially  asset  databases  that  can  be  shared  across  a  network  of  multiple  sites or institutions. All participants within a network can have their own identical  copy of the ledger. Any changes to the ledger are reflected in all copies within  minutes, or in some cases, seconds. 
Distributed  ledgers  are  inherently  harder  to  attack,  compared  to  traditional  centralized versions. Instead of a single database, there are multiple shared copies  of  the  same  database,  so  a  cyber-attack  would  have  to  attack  all  the  copies  simultaneously to be successful. The technology is also resistant to unauthorized  change or malicious tampering, as participants in the network would immediately  spot  a  change  to  any  part  of  the  ledger.  Furthermore,  the  method  by  which  information is secured and updated means that participants can share data and be  confident that all copies of the ledger at any one-time match each other. 
Traditional ledgers achieve a level of privacy by limiting information access to  the parties involved and a trusted third party. By contrast, a Blockchain system is  transparent: all network participants can examine records in the ledger. Privacy  can still be maintained, however, by breaking the flow of information in another place  — keeping  pseudonymous  public  keys,  which  correspond  to  the  participants.  The  network  can  see  that  a  transaction  occurred,  but  uninvolved  parties lack the information to link the transaction with specific identities. 
In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin [2], the first implementation of a  protocol that enables the issuance of a digital bearer instrument without a trusted  third party. This was achieved through the use of the ledger replication system  i.e.  Blockchain.  Bitcoin  solves  the  difficult  problem  of  implementing  decentralized  digital  cash,  but  its  security  model  limits  its  efficiency  and  throughput: its design only supports a single native asset, and its virtual machine  offers  limited  support  to  custom  programs  that  determine  asset  movement,  sometimes called smart contracts. 
Ethereum,  which  launched  in  2015,  develops  the  concept  of  a  Blockchain  to  a  fully programmable state replication mechanism. While it includes a much more  powerful programming language, it presents additional challenges for scalability  and  efficiency.  Its  general-purpose  computation  model  makes  it  difficult  for  engineers to reason about security of their applications.

Appendix B. Application architecture 
Fig. 4: Schematics of Primalbase applications infrastructure 
WAVES  protocols  and  routines  constitute  the  core  of  Primalbase digital  infrastructure and functionality. The advantages of using WAVES platform are:  ease  of  custom  token  creation,  low  cost  of  operations,  built-in  decentralized  exchange, and integrated work with fiat currencies. Most of the operations can be  performed without leaving the WAVES wallet. WAVES platform is compatible  and interoperable with Ethereum platform, as Ethereum is the renowned market  leader  and  popularly  used  in  crowd  sales.  We  believe  that  in  the  future  all  the  Blockchain systems will be combined into one ecosystem; therefore, the WAVES  platform was chosen as the key element of Primalbase apps. WAVES is making  great  strides  towards  this  goal,  which  will,  naturally,  increase  accessibility  and  create new opportunities.

Introduction 
The unwitting purchase of bot traffic in digital advertising markets defrauds advertisers of over $16+  billion annually.1 Opaque supply chains provide cover for botnet operators who hide behind the black  boxes of exchanges and deep within unauditable ad networks.2 Because supply chain entities downstream  from the advertiser are generally paid on a cost per mille (“CPM”) basis, their incentive alignment is  towards maximizing impressions irrespective of whether those impressions are from human eyeballs or  bots. Because botting is cheap and hard to detect, it may even be economically rational for downstream  entities to knowingly serve ads to bots. 
Ad buyers are increasingly frustrated by having their money stolen.3 While programmatic ad buying is  undoubtedly the path forward for quantifying the value of ad buys relative to direct dealing and is the  highest growth area of digital advertising, programmatic is, at present, a morass for quantifying efficacy in  advertising non-installable goods.4 The behaviors of humans on web pages are easily mimicked by bots  and the flagging of bot network signatures is essentially a cat and mouse game.5 This leaves advertisers  mostly powerless against the incentive structure of the downstream supply chain.

So long  a s  t he registry is kept clean of bot traffic, advertisers will want to service bid requests from its registrants. So long as advertisers desire  t o service  b id  re quests from  re gistrants,  re gistrants will  d esire  t o  re new their listings and unlisted publishers will desire  t o apply for  l istings.  T oken  h olders are incentivized to keep fraudulent applicants out of the registry by voting  ju diciously  to maintain  th is  v irtuous  c ycle. 
The adChain Registry 
The adChain Registry is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain which stores domain names  accredited as non-fraudulent by adToken holders. The presence of the domain foo.net in the registry  means that adToken holders have recently assessed that domain belongs to a legitimate publisher with a  real human audience. 
The Registry also exposes both an interface with which token holders propose new domains to be listed,  and one to challenge such proposals. An interface for token holders to vote on outcomes when challenges  are raised is also exposed.

Finally, an interface is exposed with which adToken holders can vote to reparameterize constant factors in  the Registry, such as the period over which listing applications are challengeable. 
Listing Applications and Data 
To apply for listing in the adChain Registry, the applicant supplies a domain name such as foo.net and an  adToken deposit. The application sits in an application pool for the duration of a challenge period. If no  challenges are raised against the application over the course of the challenge period, the domain is added  to the Registry. 
Listings in the adChain Registry are only valid for a finite period of time. Because domain names can be  sold or degrade in quality over time, a high quality domain today may be low quality tomorrow.  Registrants can apply to renew a listing prior to the lapse of its accreditation, and a successful renewal will  cause no interruption to the domain’s accreditation status. When a listing’s accreditation lapses, the  adToken deposit made with the original listing application can be withdrawn by the applicant. 
Listings may include additional, optional metadata such as whether the registrant accepts BAT6 payments or an attestation of compliance with tintr standards.  
Challenging Applications For Listing 
Applications for apparently fraudulent or low quality domains will be challenged by rational adToken  holders. To initiate a challenge against a listing application during its challenge period, a token holder  must deposit a sum of adToken equal to the deposit made by the applicant. Doing so initiates a voting  period during which token holders engage in a token-weighted vote which determines whether an  applicant is to be admitted. The voting scheme is commit-reveal and derives from Colony’s partial-lock  token weighted voting system.

If the challenge is settled in favor of the applicant, the challenger’s deposit is forfeited and the applicant’s  domain is listed in the adChain Registry. If the challenge is settled in favor of the challenger, the  applicant’s deposit is forfeited and the applicant’s domain is not listed in the adChain Registry. Applicants  can reapply for listing as often as they like if their application fails. 
When the vote concludes a percentage of the forfeited deposit is awarded directly to the winning party in  the challenge (either the applicant or the challenger) as a special dispensation. The remainder of the  deposit is divided proportionally among token voters in the winning bloc by token weight. Voters in the  losing bloc receive nothing.  
The deposit of the winning party in the challenge is always returned to them. Tokens locked for voting are  always returned to their owners regardless of whether they were cast with the majority or the minority.  Only the deposit of the losing party in the challenge is redistributed and not recoverable by its original  owner. 
Parameterization of the Registry 
There are no constant (“magic number”) values in the adChain Registry. The Registry will be instantiated  with reasonable values based on the best estimations of the creators, but all of these will be changeable by  adToken holders who may vote to reparameterize the Registry. Parameterized values mentioned so far  include: application deposit amounts, the duration of the challenge period, the duration of a registration’s  validity, the duration of the commit and reveal periods in token votes and the size of the special  dispensation made to the winning party in token votes. Parameters of the governance system itself may be  votable as well, such as the share of tokens required to initiate a reparameterization. 
As an example of how the parameterization of constant values in the registry affects the mechanics of the  game, consider the special dispensation awarded to challenge winners. Rational actors should only

challenge listing applications based on a calculation of potential earnings, which is a function of the  challenger’s expected payout and confidence in winning the token vote. The challenger stands to lose  100% of their deposit if they lose the token vote, or win some amount over their original deposit if they  win the token vote. If the special dispensation is set at 50%, a rational challenger must be above 66%  confident in their ability to win a token vote to raise a challenge.7 Thus the percentage of the applicant’s  deposit allocated as a special dispensation for the challenger determines the confidence level above which  a rational challenger will submit challenges. 
The adToken supply is non-votable, and adToken can be neither minted nor destroyed. The  1,000,000,000 adToken deployed upon instantiation will be the set number of adToken in perpetuity. 
The Virtuous Incentive Structure Between Advertisers, Publishers and adToken Holders 
Most payments  in  digital advertising  o ccur on  a  CPM basis. The CPM model creates misaligned  incentives  a nd  is  th e  s ource  o f many  is sues in the digital advertising supply chain. n advertiser pays a  publisher some fixed amount per thousand impressions and this constitutes a CPM. The problem with  the CPM model is that  i mpressions are an exceptionally weak  i ndicator of actual attention spending by  viewers. This is in part due to the fact that impressions are highly abstract notions which different  vendors assess in different ways. Vendors downstream from the advertiser are incentivized to assess what  constitutes an impression as loosely as possible.  
A malicious publisher in the advertiser to publisher example has no real incentive to report any page view  as less than a full impression. Indeed, because it is so easy for bots to impersonate human behavior on web  pages, it is often economically rational for a publisher to buy bot impressions and report them to the  advertiser as legitimate. The advertiser is incentivized to scrutinize the impression data they receive  carefully, but the task is essentially non-computable and devolves to statistical guessing. This problem is  exacerbated by the large number of intermediaries in a typical programmatic supply chain. A single ad  impression can transact between dozens of parties that sit between the advertiser and the publisher. The incentive structure of the publisher is identical to all those parties downstream of the advertiser, since  anybody who reports fraud down the line forfeits revenue for themselves by doing so. 
The key innovation of the adChain Registry is that it incentivizes the curation of a reputable supply pool  by decoupling the incentives of the registry owners (adToken holders) from CPMs. Token holders have  one concern, which is to flag fraudulent and low quality applicants to the pool and win votes to reject  those applications. The simple schelling point for these votes is around whether the applicant is fraudulent  or low-quality; voters acting rationally should settle in blocs for or against acceptance on the basis of their  assessment of those qualities. Voters who act rationally and perform good diligence will be rewarded. Less  diligent voters on the losing side incur opportunity cost without upside for having locked their adToken  uselessly over the duration of the voting period. 
A final point must be understood to close the loop on the virtuous incentive cycle between advertisers,  publishers and token holders. A “meta” schelling point for voting behavior in challenges is not explicitly  whether the applicant is fraudulent or not, but what outcome in the vote will increase the value of

adToken. While this notion should be very tightly coupled to the notion of fraudulence, it is useful to  consider it in its own right. 
Consider that the challenge game is only available to play when there are applicants in the applicant pool.  The applicant pool will only have applicants in it while publishers desire to make or renew listings in the  adChain Registry. Publishers will only desire to make or renew listings in the adChain Registry while  advertisers desire to service bid requests for ad space from publishers in that registry. Advertisers, in turn,  will only desire to service bid requests for ad space from publishers in the adChain Registry while the  Registry is considered clean relative to other ad networks and whitelists. This being the case, token holders  are incentivized to keep the registry clean by initiating challenges against suspect applicants and voting to  remove apparently fraudulent listings. 
The game design of the adChain Registry, with its deposits and voting, has a lot in common with proof- of-stake consensus in blockchains. The key difference is that blockchains verify blocks, which is  computable, while adChain verifies domains as non-fraudulent, which is not. adChain thus explores the  general pattern of using collateralized consensus mechanisms to establish single sources of truth in non- computable domains. adChain does not aim to solve advertising fraud directly, it simply allows the  advertising industry to agree on what fraud is, and where to draw the line.  
Practical Utilization of the Registry 
The adChain Registry provides a high-quality, zero-cost whitelist from which advertisers can read to  assess whether or not to service inbound bid requests on ad opportunities. The minimal contents of a  listing in the adChain Registry, however, are nothing more than a domain name and an indicator of the  listing’s accreditation status. Assuming the absence of any authentication scheme, if foo.net is an  accredited registrant in the adChain Registry a bot farm could trivially impersonate foo.net by simply  changing the origin headers of their bid request messages. 
Advertisers need to protect themselves from the trivial attack in which bot farms impersonate adChain  registrants by spoofing origin headers. While the Registry itself is unopinionated on this matter, it will be  useful for the industry to settle on a uniform way of authenticating themselves to one another. The use of  bidirectional authentication using Transport Layer Security (TLS), a widely deployed and battle-tested  suite of technologies, can address this. The unidirectional handshake protocols of TLS underpin  authentication for HTTPS connections on the Web. Bidirectional TLS handshakes underpin  authentication in the widely used SSH (Secure Shell) protocol.

Mutual Authentication Using TLS 
By pushing authentication out of the application layer and into a widely used transport layer technology  like TLS, adChain registrants can conduct ad commerce in RTB, VAST, VPAID or any other markup  format including ones which do not exist yet. It also means existing production-ready software can be  leveraged to perform the authentication, and onboarding costs for new users become as low as a few lines  in a webserver config file. 
Bidirectional TLS authentication using certificate signing keys in the Web HTTPS regime will suffice to  authenticate users in adChain. An advertiser servicing a bid request with headers indicating an origin at  foo.net will ask the sender to mutually authenticate in the TLS handshake. The recipient will expect  authentication to be performed with a key authenticable using an SSL certificate for foo.net issued by a  trusted Certificate Authority. 
The advertiser’s server implements the following branching logic: 
1. Can this client perform mutual authentication over TLS? 2. If yes, did the client authenticate properly in the TLS handshake? 3. If yes, does this domain have a listing in the adChain Registry? 
If the answer to any of those questions is “no”, the server branches off to execute arbitrary logic to handle  that case. Supporting the authentication of adChain members does not mean advertisers must forgo  business with non-adChain members. 
On the supply side, entities serving bid requests must be able to authenticate in TLS sessions using the  certificate signing key of the registrant whose domain listing they solicit bids for. Technically savvy  publishers may choose to simply run their own ad servers to retain control of their certificate signing keys.  Most publishers, however, are used to working with vendors who solicit bids and return ad markup  without requiring they do anything more than embed Javascript on their webpage. Adopting mutual  authentication means vendors must either apply for a listing in the adChain Registry or interface with  publisher-controlled signing servers. 
Rational token voters should be biased towards rejecting vendor applications because vendors aggregating  supply from multiple publishers are difficult to audit and can easily hide bot traffic amongst their  legitimate traffic. The signing server approach is likely a happy middle-ground: deploying a signing server  should not be difficult even for relatively unsophisticated publishers who desire to retain control of their  certificate signing keys, and the task can be entrusted to specialized service providers as well. 
Another possibility is for publishers to simply entrust their certificate signing keys to proxies who work on  their behalf. Sharing a certificate signing key requires high trust in the proxy, but sophisticated vendors  may be able to build businesses using this model.

Interfaces for Voting 
While the adChain Registry will be a smart contract on the public Ethereum blockchain available for  anybody’s equal use, MetaX intends to provide a user interface wrapping the Registry such that token  holders can participate in the voting process through a web browser. This interface will enable token  holders to apply for listings, open challenges, vote in challenges and vote on the parameterization of the  Registry itself. While this interface will be optional, it should make participation accessible to a much  larger audience. 
Because of the nature of smart contracts on public blockchains, anybody will be able to write their own  GUI wrappers should they so choose. Interaction with the Registry through tools like MetaMask,  MyEtherWallet, Mist or a command line will obviously work as well.

Project Governance 
A unique feature of adChain relative to other tokenized protocols is its ambition to tackle a massive  problem facing an existing industry by providing governance tools to members of that industry, and  onboarding the industry starting top-down. Brave, Gnosis, Golem, Melonport, SingularDTV and the like  are creating blockchain platforms to rival existing platforms but are designed to grow from the bottom-up,  which certainly is a valid approach. The design of adChain was motivated from the outset by the  challenge of onboarding the existing advertising technology industry. The complexity of this platform is  not entirely captured in the protocol itself, but in the interaction between the protocol and existing  industry players. The protocol is intentionally simple for this reason; if the system were too complex it  would be too difficult for industry players to determine their place within it and optimal strategies, which  would slow adoption.

Token Launch Details 
The collaboration between ConsenSys and MetaX began after an introduction  fr om  a  m utual friend,  Yorke Rhodes, a blockchain leader within Microsoft, and has been ongoing for over a year. The platform itself has been  th rough  m ultiple  ite rations and  r edesigns  o ver  th e  p ast six  m onths  a fter  r eceiving  fe edback from  c ommunity  m embers, industry participants and legal advisors. Over the past year, ConsenSys and MetaX decided to pre-sell 10% of the future tokens in order to fund development, onboard industry participants such as the DMA and their members orgs,  a nd pay for legal  a nalyses. The pre-sale of tokens  were to specifically identified participants who have an interest in seeing the adChain platform become a transformative  p rotocol  w ithin  th e advertising  te chnology  in dustry. The  1 0%  o f pre-sale tokens represent 100 million of  t he 1 billion tokens to be distributed at  t he public launch, contemplated to take place in late June, 2017. 
The token breakdown is as follows: 
! ! ! ! 
500 million to be distributed in a public token sale with a cap of $10 million sold 200 million reserved for MetaX, per the time lock schedule detailed below 
200 million reserved for ConsenSys, per the time lock schedule detailed below 
100 million sold to fund development via multiple pre-sale agreements (as described above) 
ConsenSys and MetaX will jointly deliver on the roadmap outlined in this white paper. It is the belief of  ConsenSys and MetaX that token launches in this ecosystem may be naive in selling upwards of 75%  during their first “token round.” Typical startups would exhibit an even greater failure rate if they limited  their startup capital to only one funding round. ConsenSys and MetaX believe it is better to sell tokens  over time as i) adChain achieves its targeted adoption milestones across the digital advertising industry  and ii) ConsenSys and MetaX continue to develop and release new advancements of the adChain  protocol. As such, ConsenSys and MetaX believe it is in the best interest of the platform to retain 40% of  the tokens after the first public sale. This gives the adChain team flexibility to initiate future token sales if  warranted.  
ConsenSys and MetaX plan to use part of the 40% retained tokens held in escrow as bounties for the  community to build specifically desired functionality. After year one when governance is more fully  fleshed out in the adChain protocol, ConsenSys and MetaX plan to post tokens in escrow and have token

holders vote on whether or not submissions satisfy requirements of our bounties  - this ensures that  ConsenSys and MetaX push further into decentralized control over the adChain system. 
To signal the level of commitment both ConsenSys and MetaX have for this system, each entity has  agreed to lock up all of their tokens with the following unlocking schedule:

50% unlocked 1 year after public sale 
Remaining tokens unlocked 18 months after public sale 
Future Work In adChain 
The adChain Registry and TLS authentication scheme proposed is production-ready to support server- side header bidding. To conduct server-side header bidding means a publisher or its proxy solicits bid  requests from the demand side directly, without an exchange acting as an intermediary. Server-side  header bidding has been gaining traction in advertising technology independently of the rise of  blockchains because it provides bid transparency to publishers and removes a middleman from the  demand-supply relationship.9 It works well with adChain because it is a peer-to-peer technology which  maps onto many of the design patterns becoming prevalent in the emerging field of cryptosystems. One  factor which has impeded the adoption of header bidding throughout the industry is the problem of  “discovery”, or identifying the entity on the other side of an inbound bid request. The adChain Registry is  a breakthrough for discovery in header bidding, as the bid request recipient can determine whether an  otherwise unknown entity is reputable simply by authenticating it over TLS and checking whether it has  an adChain listing. 
A long-term objective is to bring the benefits of blockchains and the adChain Registry to users whose needs cannot be fully satisfied by server-side header bidding. Enabling discovery for client-side header  bidding will be highly desirable as the web decentralizes, and supporting authentication over multi-hop  supply chains will be a breakthrough necessary for the construction of fully programmatic ad-hoc supply  chains. Using blockchains and content-addressed file systems to verify the delivery and display of ad  markup could eliminate an entire category of ad fraud. Strong attribution of identity-linked actions is a  holy grail for programmatic web advertising potentially made possible by open identity systems such as  uPort. 
Discovery For Client -Side Header Bidding 
Like server-side header bidding, client-side header bidding disintermediates exchanges and enables supply  to engage in ad commerce with demand directly and peer-to-peer. As the name implies, client-side header  bidding requests originate in the browser rather than on a publisher-controlled server. Because secrets  cannot be safely stored in browsers, authenticating supply when requests originate in the browser cannot  be done using bidirectional TLS. It may become feasible to utilize emerging client-side signing standards  to construct something like an adChain user registry, or even do so as a function of open attestation

mappings on an existing identity system. Rather than authenticate the publisher, it should be possible to  authenticate the user. 
Deep Supply Chain Auditing 
The adChain Registry allows for advertisers to authenticate bid requesters as registrants in a clean pool of  supply in a direct, peer-to-peer manner. In practice, most ad exchange today is conducted over multi-hop  supply chains. Our approach for authentication using mutual TLS is not useful for authentication  between entities in a supply chain which are not directly connected with one another. This is to say, one  can authenticate the individual they are speaking with, but not who that individual is speaking for in-band  to bidirectional TLS itself (“I am bar.net. I am working for baz.net who is working for foo.net”). To do so  will require novel application-layer authentication logic involving diffs on ad markup and signature  bundling. 
Creative Verification 
A registry could be used to allow adChain members to register hashes of individual creative assets and  metadata. The metadata could include the creative media type, its IAB Content Taxonomy  
categorization and its dimensions, for example. This registry could be used to do proactive verification of  creative throughout the supply chain, or allow publishers to blacklist classes of ads by metadata. 
Tracker Tag Registry 
A registry that allows analytics providers to register a hash of their javascript tracking tags. These tags are  used to track user engagement with advertisements on web pages, but are sometimes corrupted by hackers  and used as malware vectors to install ransomware on the computers of unsuspecting people surfing the  web. If the adChain community could enforce a vetting process for new tracker tags, and publishers could  verify tracking tags before running them, it would be harder to spread malware through advertising.  
Strong Attribution For Identity-Linked Actions 
A holy grail of web advertising technology is a demand-centric attribution protocol with provable  performance metrics. When advertisers pay for performance rather than impressions, it no longer matters  whether an impression is a human or a bot; if the impression results in a purchase, the advertiser’s  ultimate objective has been met. 
In general, attribution for actions in web advertising is low-quality. It is very difficult to measure whether  a product was purchased as the result of the purchaser having viewed advertisements unless the purchase  happens in a click-through. Even then, it remains difficult to attribute credit for that purchase to  advertisements for the same product the user may have viewed previously on different publisher sites.  Advertisers simply do not know whether what they are doing really works, and publishers are disinclined  to provide such information because it is more profitable for them to bill by eyeballs than by performance. 
Cookie-syncing and all the black magic of adtech on the web has not produced a good attribution  technology for the open web to-date. Open identity systems running on blockchains have the potential to

provide all the richness and assurance of data harvestable by closed social media platforms and finally  provide the kernel of persistence necessary for strong attributions on the open web. 
Advanced Voting and Governance Systems 
adToken holders are able to participate directly in voting on applications for listing in the adChain  Registry. It will be desirable to empower adToken holders to safely delegate their votes to smart contracts  like Gnosis prediction markets, or to trusted representatives in a similar vein to proof-of-work mining pool  participation. 
Another direction to explore is time-locking tokens used in voting, which has been discussed by Vitalik  Buterin and others.10 Time-locking tokens used in voting could increase voter stake in the adChain  community beyond the tactical game of vote outcomes, because positions could only be exited over a  strategic timeframe. 
Impression Tracking  
Beyond facilitating discovery for peer-to-peer header bidding, adChain can also be extended to function  as an accounting tool for near-realtime impression tracking. For traditional ad contracts with 30 to 60 day  settlement cycles, discrepancies in impression reporting between parties are not discovered until the  contract is complete. Discrepancies in tracked impressions commonly reach up to 20%.11 Some of these  are intrinsic to browsers and networks and come from latency, network connection errors, ad blockers,  and differences between ad server spam filtering techniques. The widespread acceptance of discrepancies  across the industry, however, is exploited through fraudulent tampering of metrics and misreporting  impressions. 
Using state channels, an advanced technique which allows for secure off-chain transactions that are  instant, private, and cost zero gas, impression events can be synchronized between peers in real time,  eliminating a category of fraud. The state channel implementation to track impressions has already been  prototyped and the code and documentation is on GitHub here:  
https://github.com/adChain/AdMarket. Once deployed, this will be the first production-ready state  channel implementation, and it will be operating at web scale, with the ability to process billions of  impressions per day, secured by smart contracts on Ethereum. 
Micropayments and a True Three -Sided Advertising Market 
As described above, the first AdMarket implementation will primarily be used for accounting; the actual  payments will happen out-of-band through traditional bank transfers. In time, the AdMarket state  channel implementation will transition to a true micropayments system. In this system, advertisers will pay  publishers tiny amounts on every cleared impression, to be settled periodically on-chain.  
Through Ethereum wallet browser extensions such as MetaMask, users will also be able to participate in  the market for their attention by automatically paying the publishers of the websites they visit the fair

market value of their advertisements in order to respectfully block their ads. Further, if users choose not to  block ads, publishers can choose to share their advertising earnings with them.  
Real Time Data Streams 
The adChain protocols can be extended to facilitate discovery and purchase of real-time data streams of  user engagement with advertisements for micropayments over state channels. This can either be sold by  advertisers and publishers who capture this data or, in what would represent a paradigm shift, by users  themselves. Users with Ethereum wallet browser extensions could capture and store their own data, and  sell authenticated data streams linked to their identities (if they choose) to analytics providers, advertising  retargeters and resellers, and other buyers.

Abstract  
Today  the  penetration  of  basic  principles and  benefits of  using  blockchain is  everywhere: it can be encountered in the game and entertainment industries as well as in  the most important activity spheres of society  – health care, education, personnel market,  payment networks, and investments, and even in the organization of the  electoral process.  
The form of attracting investments into such spheres has changed as well  – having  gone  from  writing  business  plans  and  supplying  them  to  banks  to  be  presented  in  the  offices of leading venture funds  to rapid development of digital circuits of crowdinvesting  funding called ICO in the professional sphere.  
In other words, investing has come to full tokenization of this important process. 
At the same time, already in the period of its formation and  early development ICO  caused resentment from a number of regulators, disappointed investors and the expert  community.  
The  reasons  for  this  are  simple  – the  same  economic  laws  operate  in  a  world  of  crypto-currency venture  investments  just  as  in  the  sphere  of  traditional  classic  startups:  90% of all beginnings are going to be closed because of a number of reasons – lack of  financing, absence of necessary experience and skills in the team , while sometimes just  the irrelevance of the product or service in the market.   
Systemizing  all  of  its  cumula ting experience  in  the  investment  sphere,  OnPlace  focused  all  of  its  attention  on  one  prioritized  direction  of  developing  financial  markets,  chiefly  through  the  ICO  mechanisms  – investing  into  the  businesses  of  closed  private  companies. 
We can say with abs olute certainty that investment into private IT companies has  become one of the most reliable ways to get a high  return percentage on investments in a  relatively short period of time.  
Developing the concept of the tokenization  protocol of PATS, the OnPlac e team  set before itself  the goal to lay the foundations in the partial  realization  of objectives to transition ICO to a new level: 
a) The token offers of IT companies actively leading their business  
b) The tokens of the best development teams and employers in  the world 
c) The  tokens which  are  responsible  for  innovative  solutions and  which  have  
proven their necessity in the technology market 
d) The  tokens  with  a  working  financial  model  /  a  monetization  model  and  with  
millions of users of the service around the world  
e) The  tokens  which  have  been  invested  into  by  the  biggest  traditional  VC  
investors of the world 
Below  we  present  to  you  detailed  specifications  of  our  PATS  (Private  Assets  Tokenization  System)  protocol  that  will  allow  the  community  of  investors  to  make  decisions  in  regards  to the  distribution  and  movement  of  the  above  assets  in  a  decentralized manner.

The concept of PATS protocol. The use of the protocol for the tokenization of  OTC assets 
In each time period the market presents limited offers to invest in shares of private  companies that comply in full with the criteria of the most secure and potentially lucrative  investments.  
Tokenization  of  such  investment  options  based  on  the  application  of  the PATS  protocol assumes a certain procedure:  
a) Formation of the Marketplace opportunity window 
b) Selection  of  projects  for  tokenization  based  on  criteria  and  community  
discussions of crypto -investors  
c) Tokenization of the selected projects of underlying assets using PATS  
d) Establishment and initial  input of PATS tokens of underlying assets  into liquid  
circulation  
e) Support of tokens during their life cycle, ensuring a fully decentralized control  
of the token by the token holders community

1. Formation of Marketplace opportunity window (MOW) and selection of projects  for tokenization 
When creating a pool of  Marketplace  opportunity  window (MOW) projects related to investing in private  companies, modern methods of assessing business metrics will be applied.  Business selection for investment will be made taking into account its compliance with a number of criteria: 
1) Work in the most promising and fast -growing segments of the IT market (it may  be  specialized  in  FinTech,  Data  bases,  
B2B,  Communications,  AI,  data  analysis,  
VR, payments, and ma ny others ) 
2)  Positive  dynamics  of  key  indicators and the company's operational  business  metrics,  for  example:  stable  quarterly  revenue  growth  rates  (annual)  and customers / services users increase 
3)  Successfully  conducted  fund ing  round stages “seed” and “A” 
4)  Been  funded  by  leading  VC  (several funds) at earlier stages 
5) Strong competitive position in the  industry,  and  absence  of  big  monopolist  competitors.  Presence  and  successful  development of similar products / services  in the markets of other regions 
The development of the protocol and the first wave of  improved functionality assume the implementation of a community participation mechanism in the formation of MOW,  and selection of projects via voting.  
2. Tokenization  of  selected  projects  of  underlying organization of liquid circulation of tokens 
assets  with  PATS  usage,  
Fundamentally, the concept of tokenization assumes the following: everything that  happens within the digital accounting system must have legal force, just as changes in the  real estate registry lead to the change of  land or building ownership. Tokenization in the  modern understanding of blockchain has changed its approach in managing all assets:  instead of administrating via orders, the asset is controlled directly through recordings in  the smart contract, which are essentially analogous to the digital signature.  
Applying such an approach to the management of traditional assets always brings  obvious  benefits:  it  significantly  reduces  costs,  expands  access  for  a  large  number  of  participants,  increases  the  speed  and  safety  of  asset  handling,  allows  complete  control  and audit.

Any commercial infrastructure for different classes of assets and properties involves  a number of complex components: a depository (a register that keeps records of assets  and  rights),  the  stock  exchange  (of  the  bidding  process  organizer),  elements  of  the  settlement center. Tokenization before us based on blockchain  suggests that all of these  components will be integrated as efficiently as possible, while allowing decentralization of  the entire infrastructure, having distributed storage functions and processing transactions between all parties involved.     
The  main  task  facing  the  OnPlace  team  during  the  development  of  the  protocol  tokenization  of  investments  into  shares  of  private  companies  became  the  creation  of  a  universal scalable instrument for providing a maximally  transparent  and  safe  solution  in  the OTC investment field.  
The  use of  our  protocol  allowed  us  to  solve  this  problem  and  enfor ce  a  set  of  mandatory conditions:  
a) Use of a secure and standardized channel of account management based on  
smart contracts 
b) Decentralization of audit and participants’ decision -making  
c) Integration of management principles directly into the asset itself  
Scaling  solutions  based  on  the  PATS  protocol  will  open  potential  access  for  any  person  in  the  world  to  purchase OTC  assets.  Further  development  of  functional  opportunities of the protocol should allow simple connection of additional business -logic  modules  opened  by  API  based  on  the  architecture through  improvement  of  smart  contracts, the possibility of real-time transparent audit with access to results for all parties,  the possibility of collective asset management  without requiring trust, opportunity to work  with  any  trading  platform,  adding  to  tokenized  assets  supplementary  properties  and  attributes, the possibili ty of proving the history of ownership, the possibility of separating  a tokenized asset into the smallest fractions.  
Below  are  the  definitions  of  key  concepts  and  terms  used  further  on  in  the  document:  
Tokenization - the  process  of  creating  a  digital  tok en  in  accordance  with the  technology of smart contracts, which is based on  a specific underlying asset.  Tokenization  is the  process  of  transforming  the  storage  and  management  of  an  asset,  wherein  each  asset is given a corresponding digital  double.  
An  Underlying  Asset – an  asset,  on  which  the  derivative  financial  instrument  is  based, the financial derivative. In the context of this document, the underlying assets are  assets of private companies not involved in  the stock exchange turnover.

========6========

A Derivative – a contract, by which the parties receive the right or commit to carry - out  some  actions  in  regards  to  an  underlying  asset.  Usually,  opportunities  to  buy,  sell,  provide,  obtain  certain  goods  or  stocks  are  envisaged.  In  contrast  to  a  direct  Sale  and Purchase Agreement, a derivative is formal and standard, initially providing a possibility  for at least one of the parties to freely sell this contract. The price of a derivative and the  character of its changes are closely related to the price of  the underlying asset.  
The  Token  Holder  or  the  Investor – any  person  or  user  of  blockchain  that  has  received tokens created via using the PATS protocol directly from the protocol developer  or from other former holders. 
Private Assets Tokenization System (PATS)  – a protocol created by the OnPlace  team,  which  allows  investors  (the  holders  of  issued  tokens)  to  monitor  and  control  operations over tokenized assets.  
After completing the project selection stage OnPlace legislates legal preparations  and  develops  an  agreement,  wi thin  the  limits  of  which  property  rights  over a part  of  private company shares (an underlying asset of a token) are transferred to future holders  of the created tokens.  
The implementation of protocol tokenization is designed to solve a set of difficulties  arising in the classical scheme of venture investment:  
- 
A high input threshold for most investors; 
- 
High transactional costs for processing  deals; 
- 
The lack of  complete information necessary to assess investment risks and assess  potential cost of asset growth; 
- 
Difficulties  in  the  realization  of  an  effective  mechanism  of  audit  and  control  of  investments; 
- 
Lack of sufficient (“secondary”) liquidity of investments; 
- 
A complex exiting process.

Principles and the mechanism of tokenization of underlying assets included in MOW 
We have developed PATS (Private Assets Tokenization System) protocol, which will  allow the community of investors to make decisions in a decentralized manner in regards  to  the  further  distribution  and  motion  of  tokenized  assets.  The  use  of  the  protocol  wil l  mean that each decision  in connection to transactions over tokens will be recorded in a  network with its own blockchain and will not be subject to change.  
To  solve  the  problem  of  commissioning  closed  assets  into  circulation  (shares  of  private companies) in stock turnover, we use Ethereum solutions, which allow the creation  of personal units of account in blockchain and contracts for managing them. 
Every underlying asset implemented using PATS protocol will be represented by a  separate  private  token  and  endowed  logic  of  decentralized  management  of  PATS  protocol.  
This  approach is  based  on  the  idea  of  creating  a  Decentralized  Autonomous  Organization,  in  which  each  holder  of  a  token  is  able  to  directly  affect the  asset  and  determine  further  operations  over  tokens  via  voting.  Thus,  each  decision  in  regards  to  operating over tokens will be registered in a network and will not be subject to change.  Together  with the managing  and  monitoring  functions,  PATS  protocol  provides  autonomous  safety of  investors’  balances  from  losing  funds  during  the  emission  and  closing of shares.   
Basic PATS functions allow the investor (the holder of tokens issued on the  basis of  the protocol) to: 
- 
Determine the closing date of an asset 
- 
Add new assets for examination 
- 
Vote for the emission of tokens of underlying assets / change the parameters of  circulating tokens

OnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 

========8========

- 
Produce  equivalent  trade  of  tokens  of  the  PATS  protocol  dire ctly,  without  using  third-party stock exchanges  
In the next versions of functionality improvement of the capacities of the protocol the  following capacities will be added: 
- 
Temporary halt of selling an asset 
- 
Ability  to  add  underlying  assets  of  third  partie s  into  the  PATS  system  using  its  specifications independently from the developer of the protocol.  
Tokenization  of  investments  in  private  IT  company  shares  on  the  basis  of  PATS  will  allow obtaining exceptional opportunities in expanding the circle of poten tial participants  in  the  investment  process,  while  combining  in  itself  the  most  significant  benefits  of  the  protocol  – high safety level, transparency in the form of an integrated audit mechanism  and the liquidity of investments (free circulation as crypto -currency assets). Using OnPlace  blockchain networks based on PATS will reduce transaction costs for holders more than  10 times in comparison to traditional investment methods (the average fee will not exceed  0.1%).  
All PATS tokens which will be  formed, represented and imputed into circulation on  our platform, will be provided with real assets  – private company shares.

Every token will have a set of required attributes reflected below: 
Underlying asset of a token 
Characteristics of an under lying asset: 
- Company name 
- Number and type of shares  
constituting the underlying asset 
- Value of funds invested in the  
formation of the asset

Current price for one unit of underlying  asset (share) 
Tokenized assets will be available to a wide range of crypto -investors that have  passed standard procedures in accordance to the requirements of KYC/AML. 
All PATS tokens will become tools of organized trades realized on their own  OnPlace trading platform, specialized  on decentralized management and control of their  circulation and liquidity. It is assumed that in addition to trade pairs with general  Ethereum and Bitcoin crypto -currencies, the PATS tokens will be available for direct  reciprocal trading between various underlying assets.  
Legal aspects of invest ors’ access to trading PATS tokens, presented on platforms and stock exchanges of third parties, will be carried out in accordance with the access to  
trading rules of such organizations.  
3) Ensuring decentralized co ntrol of the community of token holders. The life cycle of PATS  
tokens 
Each underlying asset included in MOW (marketplace opportunity window) and  tokenized on the basis of the PATS protocol  with the OnPlace service will receive  personal  informational and analytical base that includes all of the tools (in the classic understanding  of the exchange tools analysis) required to assess its financial stability, possible risks and  potential development. This base in a form of understandable GUI will include the  
following essential components:

Market segment analysis 
a) Venture investment market size 
The aggregated venture investment market size in the world in the year 2016 was  estimated at  $127 billion. Its annul size in the last 3 years ex ceeded $100 billion, which  practically exceeds  twice the amount of investments in 2010  – 2013.

OnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 

========11========

The  largest  market  segments  (more  than  80%)  in  the  regional  focus  are  USA  and  China, which account for  $71.8 and $31 billion respectively.  
While the Asian region is characterized by stable and positive growth of investment  
the project – financing stages B / C / D  – accounts  for  at  least  50%  of  the  total  investment size. 
The  size  of  investments  in  one project  (within  one  transaction)  o n  average is about $4.8 million in the early  stages,  in  the  later  ones  already  about  10.0.  If  one  considers  these  numbers  within specific series of financing, round  A  on  average  will  require  about  $5  million, while subsequent rounds  – about  $10-12 million. 
size,  for  the  USA  and  Europe  mixed  dynamics  of  investments  are  more  typical.  
The  absolute  industry  segment-leader  remains  the  IT  solutions domain,  software,  digital  products and services. At  the  same  time  the  share  of  investments  in  the  developmental  stage  of  
Thus,  the  venture  investments  market  is  actively developing:  in  the  medium  term positive growth and 2 -fold index increase within 3-5 years can be expected. Its most active  segment  is  the  sphere  of  IT  solutions.  Constant  high  growth  rates  d emonstrate  the investment index in the Asian region, especially in its leading region  – China.

b) Crypto currency market 
The total capitalization of crypto -currencies (today there are just over 800 of them)  by the end of  October 2017 exceeded $ 180 billion, completely restoring its levels after a  recent  decline  based  on  the  prohibition  of  bitcoin  trading    and  input  of  restriction  on  conducting ICO in China . This is ten times more than on January 1, 2017, and 25 times  more than on January 1, 2016. At the moment, the mark et capitalization is comparable in  size to the stock market capitalization of Qatar or Ireland.  
Source: http://coinmarketcap.com 
At the end of October 2017, 12 crypto -currencies have a capitalization in excess of $  1  billion,  and  total  of  their  share  was  89%  of  the  total  market  capitalization.  The  lion's  share of capitalization is, of course, Bitcoin. Now it occupies about 70% of the market, and  more  recently  - on  January  1,  2017  - BTC  accounted  for  87%  of  the  total  market  capitalization. Thus, in the  last ten months the share of BTC has seriously decreased, while  the altcoins demonstrate a faster growth in value. 
In themselves, crypto-currencies can be divided into two types: directly currencies  (that is, payment instruments or elements of the payment  infrastructure) and crypto-assets  (a rough analogue of the share  - a share in the project). In the total capitalization of the  market,  crypto  assets  still  hold  a  small  share:  only  about  4%,  while  maintaining  a  large  growth  potential.  Also  on  the  market  app eared  crypto-currencies,  which  are  an  infrastructural  function  for  crypto  assets,  a  kind  of  superstructure  for  the  functioning  of  crypto assets. And it was the appearance of crypto assets that caused Bitcoin to decrease  in the total market capitalization. 
In the medium-term perspective for 3-5 years most industry experts keep the high  expectations of market capitalization growth rates. The most authoritative experts believe  that the growth will be from 50 to 100% per year .

c) Segment market analysis of  private IT companies 
The  profitability  of  investing  in  the  business  of  the  most  successful  IT  companies  implemented  in  our  service  is  the  most  realistic  alternative  to  investing  in  crypto - currencies: see the presented calculations below. 
Source:  calculations 
company  
data,  
data  from 
https://www.crunchbase.com ,  OnPlace 
That  is,  on  average,  investments  in  the  portfolio  of  private  companies  ensure  an  investment growth of 8–10 times or about 200% per year. 
At  the  same time,  such  investments  allow  to  reduce  investment  risks  to  a  minimum  because they are not subject to high volatility, are provided with a diversified structure of  the investment portfolio, and even with the fall of individual stocks, they allow to remain  the overall portfolio of investments in the profit zone. 
If we consider the current market of investments in private companies,  shares of  the following companies can be highlighted as  the most appropriate projects for potential  investments and MOW formation at the time of  writing the document : Slack, Zenreach. The  most  telling  examples of business  capitalization  growth  that  could  become  investments  with  the  use  of  PATS  in  2012-2014  (3-5  years  ago)  are  UBER,  Spotify,  Xiaomi, Airbnb, Palantir .  
As  the  results  of  the  comparative  analysis  for  the  last  number  of  years  show,  for  investments  into  traditional  stock  exchange  assets  and  property  objects  the  return  is  rather limited and was at a moderate level: from 1.5% a year for art obj ects to a maximum  of 9.0% for fairly volatile real estate market.  
At  the  same  time  the  average  annual  return  from  investing  into  businesses  of  leading  private  IT  companies  is  estimated  at  about  100-200%, and  in  some  cases  can  reach up to 500% (which is broadly comparable with  the revenue from the price growth  of individual crypto -shares, but at a much lower risk of investing).

Financial expectations. The revenue mode l of the company 
The  use  of  PATS  protocol  and  derivation  of  tokenized  tools  into  the  market  for  investments  in  shares  of  OTC  will  allow  OnPlace  to  successfully  conduct  operational  activities and bring high income.  
During the formation  of  financial  indicators  within  this  document,  we  proceeded  from  the  following  basis:  in  the  medium  term  perspective  the  growth  rates  of  venture  investments  will  be  positive  and  are  estimated  not  less  than  10%,  the  market  size  of  tokenized  OTC  investments  will  also  be  positive  within  the  dynamics  of  the  venture  investment market, although given its current growth rate, there is a higher probability of  significantly faster tokenization growth.  
At that, the investment shares through PATS will not exceed 1% of the shares of the  venture  market,  which  is  also  quite  conservat ive,  yet  meets  the  requirements  of  the  maximum moderate realistic business development.  
OnPlace revenue will be shaped by incomes from 2 main sources: a charge  (included in the final price of the shares) for tokenization of OTC investments and charges   collected from secondary circulation of tokenized assets.

What makes Humaniq 
a big thing 
Connecting the unbanked 
10 years of research across Asia and Africa, carried out by the authors of Portfolios of the Poor,  
showed  that  poverty  proliferates  in  regions  whose  inhabitants  do  not  have  access  to  financial  
services. Humaniq is becoming the simplest route to financial inclusion for billions of people. 
User base exponential growth 
According to Metcalfe's law, the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of  
its  users.  For  Humaniq,  this  means  that  the  more  unbanked  people  who  join  the  system,  the  
greater the motivation will be for other people to join.

Humaniq use cases 
Zero fee money transfers 
Blockchain  technology  allows  users  to  carry  out  direct  money  transfers,  cutting  out  the  
middleman. The money is transferred as our HMQ cryptocurrency and withdrawn via authorised  
exchange points. Users can choose the point with the best exchange rate, therefore avoiding any  
financial monopolies. 
Remote work 
Companies  can  utilise  Humaniq's  ever-growing  user  base  to  carry  out  tasks  involving  the  
processing  of  information.  Users  can  decode  and  translate  texts,  identify  photographs,  locate  
geotags and so on, in return for renumeration. 
Charity without corruption 
Charity,  carried  out  in  the  traditional  way,  often  leads  to  a  large  proportion  of  donated  money  
falling into the wrong hands. Blockchain technology, combined with the infrastructure of Humaniq,  
ensures that donations are completely transparent: stakeholders are able to see what every penny  
is spent on and can be sure that all of their money is going to help people. 
Guarantor lending 
Grameen Bank in Bangladesh has created a system of loans based on honesty and trust, which  
guarantees over 90% repayment. The Humaniq system allows for the creation of a similar system  
but on a global scale: every person on Earth will be able to take out a commission-free loan using  
nothing but a smartphone and the Humaniq app. 
Direct lending to entrepreneurs 
Following  the  principle  of  the  non-profit  organisation  Kiva  Microfunds,  which  enables  loans  for  
entrepreneurs on low  incomes, Humaniq will become a platform for both donations and loans.

You can lend money to a business you'd like to support, either as a grant or with the expectation  
of  a  return – the  blockchain  technology  makes  this  process  incredibly  simple  and  effective  for  
both parties.

  Peerplays 
A Provably Fair Blockchain-Based Gaming Platform 
Jonathan Baha’i, Michael P. Maloney 
May 2016 
                          

========1========

Abstract 
The online betting and gambling industry has been constantly plagued with accusations of fraud and cheating by both players and system administrators. In the United States alone, over a dozen online gaming sites have either gone bankrupt or been forcefully shut down by authorities since 2011, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in deposits that have yet to be returned to players. Despite these setbacks, the industry continues to grow, and players continue to risk depositing their funds into centrally owned and operated gaming websites. 
Provably fair online gaming is badly needed. Enter Peerplays, a solution for provably fair blockchain-based gaming that allows users to design their own specialized tokens or chips, buy or sell gateway tokens for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether and then wager these tokens in on-chain games. 
There is no “house” in Peerplays, but instead players are matched with other users for peer-to-peer gameplay through a series of smart contracts. These contracts escrow the funds wagered by each player and then release them to the winner ​after specific conditions within a game are met and verified. Smart contracts are built directly into the native blockchain code rather than a virtual scripting machine, which makes transaction processing fast enough to enable millions of players to interact almost simultaneously.

Introduction 
A Peer-to-Peer Marketplace is an online exchange that brings people and/or businesses together to deal with each other directly without having to go through traditional slow and expensive multi-party networks. In these marketplaces, motivated individuals with resources and specific skills or talents can simply connect with willing customers through a 3rd party “dispatch” service, consisting of either an online platform or mobile app to facilitate a commercial exchange of goods or services and payment between the buyer and seller. Airbnb, eBay, Etsy, Freelancer, Kickstarter, Mr. Delivery, and Uber are examples of the most successful of Peer-to-Peer networking models today. 
With the advent of blockchain technologies, and specifically the platform called G​raphene,​it is now possible to launch a peer-to-peer dispatch service that runs almost entirely on its own. Graphene is a​n open-source, MIT licensed, decentralized blockchain technology that utilizes a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, w​hich leverages the power of stakeholder voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. Commercial interactions between users facilitated by Graphene are cheaper and faster than a traditional company due to greatly reduced overhead costs, while membership and operational criteria is still flexible enough to grow and adapt through a democratic process. 
Even better, all actions on the blockchain are publicly accessible for audit and verification, eliminating the possibility of cheating. And since decentralized blockchains cannot easily be turned off or shut down by external agencies, blockchain-based companies may be among the first organizations in history to enjoy complete global autonomy. This has recently sparked a worldwide movement to promote and explore blockchain technologies as a potential catalyst for new social, political, cooperative, and for-profit business models. 
One such model addressed by Peerplays is the creation of a provably fair and auditable gaming platform, because the online betting and gambling industry has been constantly plagued with accusations of fraud and cheating by both players and system administrators.​1 Peerplays also offers an alternative for payment processing of wagers, as the current legacy system often involves complex legal compliance hurdles which have to be dealt with separately in each country of operation.​2 If payment processing can be outsourced to a decentralized blockchain, 3rd party gaming partners can unburden themselves in ways that lower the barrier to entry into the marketplace. 

========4========

Blockchain Consensus 
Graphene, the technology behind Peerplays, is the same platform used by BitShares, Steem, and Muse. It currently offers the fastest block production times and the highest throughput of any decentralized blockchain consensus mechanism available - supporting 3 second blocks and a potential throughput capacity of over 100,000 transactions per second.3​On a Graphene-based blockchain, stakeholders elect trusted signing “witnesses”, and a periodic, randomly chosen deterministic block signing order allows each witness to know when their turn to sign is approaching. Thus, block production speed is only limited by the bandwidth capacity of the signing nodes and the speed of light - which is about 1 second for a packet to circle the globe - meaning a high bandwidth network could achieve about 1 second average block times. 
The high throughput capacity of a Graphene-based blockchain is due to a number of architectural specifications modelled after the LMAX (online FX trading) exchange, which has achieved upwards of 6 million transactions per second (TPS).​4 Some of these highly streamlined design parameters include the l​imiting of the core business logic to a single thread, the removing of cryptographic operations (hashes and signatures) from the core business logic, the division of validation into state-dependent and state-independent checks, the use of an object oriented data model, and keeping databases memory-resident.5​ 
Adding new features to a Graphene blockchain requires stakeholder approval, but this process is a largely seamless experience for users because most will use the lightweight or hosted clients, and only full nodes are required to upgrade. On the BitShares network, for example, hard forks usually take a few hours and disruption for most users is minimal to none. 
                      

========5========

Native Smart Contracts 
Here is what Daniel Larimer, lead developer for Graphene, says about running Smart Contracts on Graphene: 
The BitShares Decentralized Asset Exchange uses an order matching algorithm which is a wonderful example of one such “natively supported” smart contract.​6 
​This 
feature allows buy and sell orders between users to be filled instantly and has been proven in stress tests to handle thousands of unique transactions per second.​7 Furthermore, we can use the analogy o​f “opening and filling orders” within a marketplace to describe Peerplays ​player matching - the operation through which players interact with one another using the gaming tournament smart contracts. 
To begin the process, each player opens an “order” which is then accepted and “filled” by the appropriate on-chain smart contract. The smart contract then matches pairs or groups of players together, arbitrates the terms and rules of the game between players and releases the funds to the winner. We have coined the term ​Peerplays Marketplace​to describe this feature. 
Step 1: A Player opens/broadcasts an ​Offer to Contract​, henceforth referred to as OTC, into the Peerplays Marketplace. Each OTC contains the appropriate funds to buy-in to the desired game, as well as other data required to define the terms in which he wishes to engage in the desired game or tournament. 
Step 2:​OTCs are matched by a player matching (order matching) algorithm. 

========6========

Step 3: After players are matched, game play begins and players voluntarily interact (compete) with each other to fulfill the conditions set forth by the rules of the particular game or tournament and their agreement with the Smart Contract. 
Step 4: Funds are unlocked by the Smart Contract and sent to the winner, minus any fees which the blockchain automatically distributes to the appropriate places via profit sharing (section 4). 
Additionally, an essential element for most games on Peerplays includes the on-chain Random Number Generator (RNG) and shuffle program which can generate numbers which are then encrypted to a player’s private/public key pairing and published on the blockchain. Players are then able to publish or reveal blinded cryptographic signatures to “prove” their positions or holdings in the game, and fast and reliable block times means they can do so with the speed and frequency necessary to facilitate real-time gameplay for on-chain casino card games, popular board games, and other games of skill. 
Provably Fair Gaming 
Peerplays is a universally auditable platform. All smart contracts are written in open-source code, so it is easy to verify that they are functioning as advertised. By broadcasting an OTC, each player essentially enters into an “arbitration agreement” with the blockchain, after which time their only recourse is to follow the rules. The release of escrowed funds is always dependent on voluntary moves (or lack thereof) on the part of each player, so failure to perform these actions in a timely manner, or failure to produce the “winning hand” automatically removes a player’s eligibility to receive the jackpot payout. 
By way of explanation, let us create a hypothetical game called ​High Card​. Here are the rules of this game: 
Two players place an initial wager (ante), and then each is dealt a single card from a 52 card deck. After each player looks at her card, a round of betting ensues, or either player can fold. If both remain, then each reveals their card and the highest card wins. (Note: suits would also have to be ranked from high to low, for example diamonds low, then clubs, then hearts, and then spades high.) 
To play this game on Peerplays, each player opens an OTC for the game which includes the appropriate ante. After they are matched, the smart contract locks up their funds and the RNG 

========7========

deals each of them a card “face down” - meaning each player’s card is published on the blockchain but encrypted to their private/public key pair. 
Then, they are each be able to view their individual cards without revealing it to the other, and make their decisions on whether to bet or fold. Betting involves sending additional funds to the smart contract to escrow. If either player folds, then the smart contract releases the funds to the other player. If one bets and the other calls, or if both pass on the round of betting, then it is time to reveal the cards. 
To do this, each user must publish the decrypted version of their secret, which can then be proved to be equal to the encrypted version by re-encrypting it with their public key. This “proof” is validated automatically by the blockchain code when the user publishes the decrypted version. The smart contract then awards the funds to the player with the higher card. If either player fails to reveal their proof within a certain time limit, they automatically forfeit the jackpot. 
At launch, Peerplays will allow players to choose single-elimination tournament brackets which facilitate multi-player tournaments by pairing off players in head-to-head competition through a series of rounds. The randomized player matching algorithm will prevent or greatly reduce the ability for players to collude, and individual head-to-head games are not subject to collusion in the same way as multi-player tables. 
These are just a few of the basic tools and features which will be available on Peerplays. Using only these functions we have outlined here, an almost unlimited variety of on-chain games can be written and implemented. 
Profit Sharing 
The Peerplays network earns revenue from various operations like the creation and trading of digital asset tokens by users, and the performance of certain custom operations, but most notably from the rake - which is a percentage of each jackpot deducted as a fee. This model allows the network to financially benefit from the trustless arbitration of each tournament and thus prevents Peerplays from having to act as a “house” and bet against its users. 
Every time a fee is collected, the blockchain automatically splits it into a virtual account governed by a smart contract which distributes the fees in three directions. ​The largest percentage is distributed at regular intervals into the accounts of Peerplays core token holders as profit sharing. ​This means that core token holders receive a portion of every jackpot paid in any of the ​certified wagering instruments​, along with a portion of the rest of the 

========8========

network fees. Another term for the core tokens is ​Fee-Backed Assets or ​FBAs​, because they entitle the holder to a portion of the fees collected by the network.​8​The next portion is directed towards blockchain maintenance, such as for paying block producers and fixing bugs. And the third portion is sent to the M​ega-Jackpot virtual accumulation account (outlined in the next section). All of these fees and percentages are determined by the elected Peerplays Committee members, who are voted for by the Peerplays token holders. 
The flowchart below explains how player’s fees are distributed  
Note: Hosted clients never have control over players funds, they merely offer an “access point” into Peerplays. 
Mega-Jackpots and PowerUp Points 
Mega-Jackpot tournaments are a way for the Peerplays network to occasionally become the sponsor of large tournament jackpots by utilizing the network’s unique “profit sharing” capabilities. Peerplays automatically allocates a small percentage of every network fee into a smart contract-secured virtual account called the M​ega-Jackpot Fund.​This smart contract then automatically schedules and hosts Mega-Jackpot tournament events, and the funds are unlocked and instantly transferred to the tournament winners. 
PowerUp points are the user-reward tokens of the Peerplays network, and are distributed according to win-loss records and amounts wagered, among other factors. PowerUp is the only token accepted as the buy-in fee for Mega-Jackpot tournaments, so they will be in high demand during Mega-Jackpot sign up periods. They are tradeable on the asset exchange, and 

========9========

players can use them for purchases, rewards, or include them in sponsored Jackpot pools for their own Custom tournaments. 
Open Source GUI 
All the operations for regular gameplay on Peerplays will be integrated into a basic open­source  Graphic User Interface (GUI) for a seamless user experience. This GUI will be published and  maintained,  exposing  all  the basic blockchain functions including simple tools for players to  create their own buy­in games, organize and host multi­player tournaments, and buy, sell and  create tokens. It will also support live gameplay for all on­chain games. The user interface will  be translated into several languages, and will have a modified BSD licence for both personal  and commercial use.  
  
  
Trustless Asset Exchange 
As a Graphene Blockchain, Peerplays has the same asset creation and exchange features as BitShares,​9 
​enabling 
users to create their own tokens, and place buy and sell orders on the internal market which are filled by the on chain order matching smart contract. They can also transfer, buy and sell gateway tokens for popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH and price-stable ​SmartCoins from the BitShares platform from a growing number of reputable gateway services. Players can even provide their own profitable gateway services by buying and selling in-game assets for popular RPGs. 
Wagering 
The Peerplays tournament smart contract accepts any user issued token for wagering, but charges a small fee if the tokens are not one of the ​certified wagering instruments​. These instruments are chosen in accordance with standards of acceptable value as determined by the committee. Certified instruments charge a ​rake fee in place of the standard registration fee, which is automatically distributed as part of the profit sharing program. Users can also place wagers with the Peerplays core token. 
Hosted (Public) Client Portals 
Hosted client portals are a way for users to access the Peerplays blockchain through their web browser,​10 while their private keys are stored locally. They are more convenient than private desktop clients, but like most cryptocurrency wallets they require backups to prevent 

========10========

accidental loss of funds. P​rivate desktop client portals operate much like lightweight wallets that do not require the user to download a full node, but instead reference a series of trusted public nodes. For the highest level of security, users can also run their own full node in conjunction with the desktop client. 
Operating a public hosted client portal is an opportunity for businesses to make extra income through the referral program or by building and connecting an independent 3rd party website to organize and host their own server-side tournaments. 
Server-Side Tournament Hosting 
Server-side game hosting is still a trusted and proven model in the eSports industry, and has seen explosive growth in the past 5 years. Peerplays supports optional server-side hosting of games while offering a variety of tools for business enhancement. For example, s​imply connecting to Peerplays through the API allows anyone to utilize the decentralized network for processing of wagers and jackpots w​hile continuing to operate an independent website. Peerplays’ customizable tournament management smart contract lets any game publisher, advertiser, tournament host or vendor create their own t​ournament structures, fee schedules, and wager collection & distribution methods for any off-chain (server hosted) game in the world. And ​gaming partners can offer additional benefits and perks to users by designing their own custom GUI or even by simply hosting the basic open-source Peerplays GUI on a public server. 
Peerplays also has a blockchain guaranteed referral program which automatically p​ays a percentage of lifetime revenue for each new player referred to the network, which means businesses can earn major “kickbacks” b​y plugging into Peerplays and getting all their existing users to sign up for a Peerplays account. 
Conclusion 
Peerplays offers a unique value proposition to both end users and existing businesses. By combining provably fair gaming with a decentralized blockchain-based wagering, Peerplays effectively tackles several key industry challenges while offering strong incentives for existing gaming platforms to integrate. Overall, the platform is well equipped for future growth and adaptation to changing market conditions due to its next-generation voting and consensus mechanisms, and is strongly positioned to become the premiere go-to provider for blockchain based solutions in the online gaming industry.
