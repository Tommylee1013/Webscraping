What makes Humaniq 
a big thing 
Connecting the unbanked 
10 years of research across Asia and Africa, carried out by the authors of Portfolios of the Poor,  
showed  that  poverty  proliferates  in  regions  whose  inhabitants  do  not  have  access  to  financial  
services. Humaniq is becoming the simplest route to financial inclusion for billions of people. 
User base exponential growth 
According to Metcalfe's law, the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of  
its  users.  For  Humaniq,  this  means  that  the  more  unbanked  people  who  join  the  system,  the  
greater the motivation will be for other people to join.

— 05. 
Simplicity and safety for the unbanked 
Biometric authentification 
Users are verified by their face and voice, eliminating the need for formal documentation 
Independent HMQ currency 
Every new user receives $20 worth of HMQ in their account, the value of which bears no relation  
to their local currency 
The interface is simple to interact with 
Even for those who have never used gadgets before

Extraordinary opportunitites for business 
Based on Ethereum blockchain protocol 
Guaranteed  security  against  hacking,  corruption  and  loss  of  information  thanks  to  complete  
decentralisation

Humaniq use cases 
Zero fee money transfers 
Blockchain  technology  allows  users  to  carry  out  direct  money  transfers,  cutting  out  the  
middleman. The money is transferred as our HMQ cryptocurrency and withdrawn via authorised  
exchange points. Users can choose the point with the best exchange rate, therefore avoiding any  
financial monopolies. 
Remote work 
Companies  can  utilise  Humaniq's  ever-growing  user  base  to  carry  out  tasks  involving  the  
processing  of  information.  Users  can  decode  and  translate  texts,  identify  photographs,  locate  
geotags and so on, in return for renumeration. 
Charity without corruption 
Charity,  carried  out  in  the  traditional  way,  often  leads  to  a  large  proportion  of  donated  money  
falling into the wrong hands. Blockchain technology, combined with the infrastructure of Humaniq,  
ensures that donations are completely transparent: stakeholders are able to see what every penny  
is spent on and can be sure that all of their money is going to help people. 
Guarantor lending 
Grameen Bank in Bangladesh has created a system of loans based on honesty and trust, which  
guarantees over 90% repayment. The Humaniq system allows for the creation of a similar system  
but on a global scale: every person on Earth will be able to take out a commission-free loan using  
nothing but a smartphone and the Humaniq app. 
Direct lending to entrepreneurs 
Following  the  principle  of  the  non-profit  organisation  Kiva  Microfunds,  which  enables  loans  for  
entrepreneurs on low  incomes, Humaniq will become a platform for both donations and loans.  

========8========

You can lend money to a business you'd like to support, either as a grant or with the expectation  
of  a  return – the  blockchain  technology  makes  this  process  incredibly  simple  and  effective  for  
both parties.
