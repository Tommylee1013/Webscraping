1. INTRODUCTION 
Today, lottery is the largest social and entertainment game in the world. The share  of lotteries on the world’s gambling market is over 30 %. The annual turnover of  this market today is $284 billion. Along with the penetration of the Internet and  the growing number of devices connected to a network, the number of users who  prefer playing this game online is growing. Consequently, the online lottery market  today is promising area.  
But despite such popularity, the lotteries currently present on the market cannot  provide the user with a 100 % guarantee of an honest lottery or offer full transparen- cy with regard to the formation and distribution of the prize fund. It is not surprising  that this issue is a hot topic for discussion on forums and in private conversations  among amateurs who like try their fortune in this game. Unfortunately, at present  one can see licensed operators periodically caught in various sorts of violations re- garding prize fund distribution and the honesty of the lottery. Just as important are  the conditions for receiving awards, which also have a number of shortcomings in  the form of delayed payments and various kinds of commissions. 
Now, thanks to smart contracts, we have the ability to address these critical issues.  KIBO is a decentralized lottery, the main advantage of which is the complete trans- parency of all processes taking place on the platform and the fundamental absence  of opportunities for fraud. Unlike “fair play checks”, which allow one to check game  results in existing cryptocurrency lotteries, KIBO itself eliminates the potential for  fraud. This is made possible by Ethereum and the concept of smart contracts. The  marketing component of the lottery is also implemented based on smart contracts,  allowing franchise partners and owners of KIBIT tokens to be sure of receiving their  earnings and the correctness of its calculation.  
KIBO is a platform where all processes are implemented and managed by smart  contracts. Ticket purchase, random number generation, and prize payouts, as well  as accruals in the distributed partner network, are performed by a smart contract  without the possibility of intervention by third parties.   Changes in the platform are  made by a vote of control token holders

ETHEREUM AS THE BASIS FOR IMPLEMENTATION 
For implementation of the project, the Ethereum [2] decentralized network, which  uses the concept of “smart contracts”, was chosen. Ethereum has great potential  for scaling [3] and the broad support of the cryptocommunity and investors. Cur- rently, the network is theoretically capable of handling about 10 transactions per  second; this is enough to start project implementation. 
Methods for network scaling presented in the above-mentioned report [3] will make  it possible to accept more than 50 million users in the near future.

2. The KIBO framework 
Currently, Ethereum infrastructure cannot yet offer a complete solution which in- cludes the decentralized part of the interface (the required functionality will appear  at the Metropolis stage. An excerpt from Ethereum’s offcial blog [5]: 
As it is not yet possible to decentralize the application interface itself at the mo- ment, the KIBO project is implemented partially in a server infrastructure which con- tains standard solutions for such cases, as well as a specialized application based  on smart contracts. In parallel with the work on the server solution, we are working  on various options for decentralizing the interface part, including our own solution.

3. The contract scheme. 
The KIBO Ethereum infrastructure is a set of contracts which interact with each  other according to the scheme below: 
At the initial stages of the platform’s work, contracts in the system can be replaced  (by the voting of control tokens, which at this stage are in the team of KIBO devel- opers). Upon completion of the test and development stages, the relations between  contracts will be recorded and subsequent changes in contracts and their relation- ships will not be possible. 
A. Managing contract 
The contract which coordinates the interaction of all other KIBO contracts, such  as lotteries or voting contracts. New user registration, lottery ticket purchases and  implementation of decisions adopted in a voting contract are performed by means  of referencing the managing contract. 
KIBO Whitepaper

========5========

B. Repository 
 repository contract is used to store data about users, franchisee partners and their  relationships. It should be noted that the contract only stores anonymous data that  are not linked to the user’s identity (the user is defned by his/her alias and wallet),  so any system user can be completely anonymous. 
Modifcation of certain data in the repository is only possible from the managing  contract; the central contract address is determined by voting of control token hold- ers. 
struct K_Users_User { 
uint shareholder; 
uint big; 
uint small; 
uint partner_type; 
string username; 
uint[8] partner_parents; 
uint[8] partner_parents_level; 
uint[8] player_parents; 
uint[8] player_parents_level;    
} 
// if user is shareholder  
// amount of kibits 2 user 
// if user is partner 
// 0 - new, 1 - registered before platform start // login 
// parents-partners structure for 7 levels // user have %q% partners at level of 7 
// parents-players structure for 7 levels // user have %q% players at level of 7 
C. Voting contract 
A contract that stores a list of issues for the management of all contracts, as well as  the conditions for making decisions on these issues. The voting and decision-mak- ing system is implemented such as to allow the development of the platform and  the addition of new games to KIBO’s functionality without the possibility of interven- tion in the algorithms for accrual and work with the customer base of the separate  branch of each partner. Only control token holders have the right to vote in this  contract. 
struct K_Ballot_Type { 
string theme; 
uint quorum; 
uint need; 
uint length; 
} 
//  issue text 
//  quorum for decision-making as a % //  % for decision-making //  voting duration (seconds) 
KIBO Whitepaper

4. Contract management 
Contract management is carried out by voting of control token holders. The list of  issues and the decision-making conditions for each of them is initially set in the  contract. Any control token holder can initiate voting on any issue in the list and  vote.  Voting results are accepted in the case of a positive vote of 30 % to 51 % of  control token holders, depending on the importance and impact on the subsequent  development and operation of the KIBO platform of the issue put to vote. 
To further stimulate voting activity, the following mechanism has been implement- ed: accrual of remuneration per token upon voting is carried out immediately after a  control token holder votes. The amount of remuneration for all 10,000 tokens is 1 %  of turnover from all platform lotteries. 
When tickets are purchased, funds are distributed as follows 
Branch bonus: 17% 
Payout on KIBITS: 14% 
Lottery prize fund: 68% 
Payout on control tokens: 1%

10 % 
For payout of bonus- es for the line-by-line  branch network. 7 %  distributed upwards,  
1 % per level. 
Payout on KIBIT

14 % 
Deferred payout on  
control tokens 
1 % 
Prize fund formation  
68 % 
5. Tokens 
The KIBO platform has several different types of tokens, each of which has its own  set of features and an expanded incentive system. All Payouts and accruals of re- muneration in the branch network and all types of tokens are triggered when tickets  are purchased (this is the most frequent action in the system). Payouts of prizes to  players are also triggered by this and in one more way described below in the “Pay- out” section. All platform tokens are not KIBO internal currency and are not intended  for internal settlements in the system. All payouts and remunerations are made  directly to the user’s wallet in ETH cryptocurrency. 
KIBO control token  10,000 units are intended for contract management. It allows  one to put issues to a vote (voting contract) or vote on an issue. To further stimulate  voting activity, 1 % (in ETH cryptocurrency) from the total turnover of all lotteries  connected to the KIBO system is accrued to all 10,000 tokens. Accrual of remu- neration takes place at all times; however, the actual payout to the user’s wallet is  carried out only at the moment a control token holder votes. Thus, we strengthen  the motivation to vote, even for minority holders of control tokens. 
At the initial stage, control tokens will be distributed among the managing partners.  In the future, all or part of the control tokens may be distributed among a large num- ber of partners interested in the project’s development and growth. These are major  holders of KIBIT tokens or owners of platforms with large client bases. 
KIBO Whitepaper 
07 

========8========

This mechanism is incorporated in the smart contract algorithm in order to transfer  contract management to a decentralized basis in the future. 
KIBIT token:  The KIBO platform’s main investment asset. There are a total of 350  million tokens, to which 14 % of total turnover from all platform lotteries is accrued.  
As part of the marketing strategy, at the crowd-sale stage 100 million KIBIT tokens  will be distributed, to which 4 % of turnover will be allocated. The remaining 250 mil- lion are owned by the development team and will form the company’s income and  will be used at the team’s discretion, including for further platform development,  options within the team, and other strategic decisions.  
Tokens not sold during the sale remain under the control of the managing partners.  Income generated by these tokens may be 
sent to a specifc address by voting. 
KIBO PLATFORM token:  Allows one to become a KIBO branch owner and receive  the  respective  bonus  for  the  expansion  of  the  client  network  and  building  of  a  branch  network.  All  operations  and  payouts  of  remuneration  in  the  operation  of  KIBO branches are guaranteed by a smart contract. There a total of 20,000 base  (Kibo Platform) tokens 
The branch owner receives 10 % from all tickets purchased by clients invited by him  5 levels deep 
KIBO Whitepaper

========9========

Also,  the  KIBO  platform’s  functionality  incorporates  the  possibility  of  expanding  one’s own branch network by sending registration links and platform recommen- dations  at  the  time  of  the  crowdsale.  When  there  are  such  networks,  additional  accruals from each of these platforms will be 10 % from the income of all partner  branches up to the 7th level. 
Thus, 17 % will be paid out from the purchase of each ticket to stimulate the devel- opment of the client network and branch network. 10 % from ticket sales is paid out  to the client base owner, and 7 % is allocated among 7 levels upwards, 1 % each, for  payout to higher branches, which is equal to 10 % of the partner’s income at each  level.

6. Integrated marketing tool to promote continuous 
platform growth 
The user can participate in promotions and draws which are present on the KIBO  LOTTO platform. Any player can invite other players to the platform using his own  link and receive 5 % of the invited players’ winnings on a constant basis. This mech- anism is also managed by a smart contract and is part of a marketing strategy  called “game with friends”. Receipt of winnings from a game with friends is gov- erned by the following rules: 
To receive 5 % of the winnings of invited players:  
At level 1 you must have bought 1 ticket for this draw  At level 2 you must have bought 3 tickets for this draw At level 3 you must have bought 7 tickets for this draw 
Thus, the player is interested in inviting other players, because 
every invited person will greatly increase the chances of winning in each draw.  
Promotion 
An important marketing component embedded in the KIBO platform smart con- tract is the proper motivation of each client at all levels of development, both for  ordinary users and for the platform owners.  
In the promotional draws, which will continue for three months after the platform  launch, everyone can take part in a series of free draws with large cash prizes. This  promotion is aimed at expanding the client base of each branch and KIBO LOTTO  as a whole. Each player, as part of this promotion, will be able to give his friends the  opportunity to participate in this series of draws. The free tickets received by a play- er as a gift win only if 6 numbers are matched. As in the “Game with friends” mecha- nism, if a player at one of the three levels below another player wins, the latter player  receives 5 % of the amount won by the former player.  To obtain this bonus, it is not  necessary to buy tickets; the player needs only activate his free tickets for this draw.  
KIBO Whitepaper

========11========

Free ticket activation and protection against bots. 
To reduce the risk of possible bot attacks during free draws, free ticket activation  for a new player is carried out through balance refll in an amount of $1 or more.  After that, a restriction on cash withdrawal is set and funds in the amount of $1  cannot be withdrawn, but are at the user’s disposal. They are available for purchase  of tickets for participation in any paid draws that are held on the platform along with  the promotions. The user can withdraw any amount above $1 at any time. Once this  account has purchased 3 tickets on the platform, the restriction is automatically  removed, and from that point on the user can withdraw all the funds and zero out  the balance.  Thus, a bot attack becomes very costly and is comparable to simple  participation in the lottery, but for larger amounts. 
Prize fund formation and distribution. 
68 % of a ticket purchase is allocated to prize fund formation.  
Comments:  Since we have tickets from which payouts for the partner and client  bonus do not come entirely, as they fall within the area of non-distribution, there is  always a remainder. This remainder is always used to replenish the current draw  prize fund. This means that in fact the percentage used for prize fund formation is  different each time and is always greater than 68 %. Let us take the initial 68 % as  the basis for the description. These funds are intended for payouts related to the  lottery and distributed according to the reserve funds system within the contract as  follows 
KIBO Whitepaper 
11 

========12========

10% are deposited to the “reserve fund”, from which a guaranteed minimum jackpot  is formed for the next draw, if a jackpot is to be awarded in the current draw.   
13.5%  are used for the formation of a fund from which 5 % are paid three levels  upwards if a player with players above that invited him wins. Part of these funds will  not be spent each time after draw completion. For example, if a player who has only  one player above him wins. In this case, 10 % will not be paid to anyone. After each  draw, the unclaimed remainder from this fund is automatically sent to the “reserve  fund” of this lottery.  
76.5%  are used for the formation of the prize fund, from which the jackpot and oth - er prizes are formed. 
Next, 2 of the 4 lotteries presented on the platform at launch are 
described as an example. 
Lottery 6/49 
76.5 % of funds received for the formation of the prize payout fund in the lottery  6/49 are allocated as follows. 
First of all, 48 % goes towards jackpot formation. By directing the funds from a  purchased ticket to increase the jackpot frst of all, we always know the jackpot size  even before the draw and we can refect its increase in proportion with ticket sales.  Other prizes are formed after draw completion from the remaining 52 % as follows.   
Fixed prizes are calculated frst  
Tickets that guessed 2 main balls are frst. These players receive a prize in  an amount equal to the ticket price. 
Next, those who guessed 2 main balls + bonus ball receive their payout. The  amount of the payout is 1.7 times the ticket price. 
Next, those who guessed 3 main balls receive their payout. The amount of  the payout is 3 times the ticket price. 
The remaining funds are allocated among those who guessed 4 numbers or more  in the following order: 
4 main balls 57 % 
5 main balls + bonus ball 16 % 5 main balls 27 % 
KIBO Whitepaper 
12 

========13========

For example: 10 players guessed 5 balls; 27 % is allocated among them in equal  shares. 
Jackpot increase 
If in the current draw the jackpot is not won, the jackpot funds (48 %) go to increase  the next jackpot. That is, we take the 48 % and add them to the amount that is  allocated for the jackpot from the ticket sales for the next draw. Thus, the jackpot  continues to grow until it is won. Once the jackpot is won, the contract accesses  the reserve fund and withdraws the amount for the minimum guaranteed jackpot,  which increases from ticket sales according to the same scheme.  
General points   
A lottery contract is intended for conducting a lottery and storage of its draw results. Only the last 8 draws + the current draw are stored. 
To generate random numbers, a combination of several factors is used: 
Every time a ticket is purchased, the user transmits a random set of data   (automatically generated by frontend by default) 
After completion of the draw, the contract takes hashes of every other block  out of the 14 blocks after draw completion and mixes them with the ran- dom data from users.

  // generate 7 numbers (6 + 1 bonus number)

    if (game - 1 > 0) { 
      uint counter = 1; 
      uint tmp_num = 0; 
      for (uint i = 0; i < 6; i++) { 
        tmp_num = generateResultNum(game - 1, i, counter); 
        while(!checkResult(tmp_num)) { 
          tmp_num = generateResultNum(game - 1, i, counter); 
          counter += 1; 
        }

    return num; 
  } 
JokerBall lottery 
In the JokerBall lottery, unlike in 6/49, the winning combination takes into account  not only the digit, but also its position in the number. The JACKPOT is fxed and is  allocated among the winners in the following way: 
Coincidence 
Prize 
2 
0.0003 % of the Jackpot per one ticket 
3 
0.0006 % of the Jackpot per one ticket 
4 
0.005 % of the Jackpot per one ticket 
5 
0.05% of the Jackpot per one ticket 
6 
2 % of the Jackpot per one ticket, but not more 
than 100 % 
7 
100 % of the Jackpot on all tickets 
Random number generation is similar to that for lottery 6/49. The lottery scheme is  also identical to that for lottery 6/49

7. Payout of winnings 
Due to the technical limitations of the ETHEREUM network at the moment, payouts  of winnings are made at the user’s request (a click on the button in the user inter- face next to the corresponding draw). 
Due to the fact that in order to make the payout, a large number of records in the  contract must be sorted (since payouts on some matches are made as a percent- age, that is, they depend on the number of people who guessed the given combina- tion), the payout is not made immediately, but only after sorting all the necessary  data. 
For one user’s payout request, 100 tickets are sorted; after all the tickets have been  sorted,  the actual payout to all users is launched by clicking the “payout” button  (100 payouts per click). Payouts are made only to those users who have clicked the  “payout” button.  
Thus, in order to complete sorting and payouts on all the tickets, one out of ffty  users who purchased a ticket needs to take his winnings. As the Ethereum network  scales up, the number of tickets sorted in a single operation will increase.

8. Conclusion 
This document presents a part of the technological and marketing solutions that  are planned in the process of the KIBO platform’s development. Also, as the Ethe- reum blockchain improves, we will actively use emerging network capabilities that  will make KIBO the most reliable and extensive decentralized lottery in the world,  and will provide an opportunity to all those who joined the platform at the starting  period to share our success.  
9. Roadmap 
The launch of the KIBO platform will take place in the following stages: 
1. BTC: Launch of the lottery on Bitcoin, Presale.
