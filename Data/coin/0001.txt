v1.1 
Introduction 
The Plutus Mobile Application enables a user to make contactless Bitcoin payments at any merchant with a Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled checkout terminal. This is the most practical way to pay with Bitcoin, because the payment process consists only of holding a mobile device above the merchants NFC reader. As a result, Bitcoin payments are eﬀectively accepted by proxy at over 32 million brick and 
mortar merchants around the world. 
The primary purpose of Plutus is to provide incentive for, and enable, the practical day-to-day usage of Bitcoin; ultimately accelerating mass-consumer adoption. 
The competitive advantage of Plutus, within the mobile payments industry, is the eﬀective utiliza- tion of the rapidly expanding Ethereum network. Through a transparent and decentralized network protocol, underwritten by distributed ledger technology (the blockchain), Ethereum allows Plutus to de- ploy smart contracts to enable secure, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of ﬁat currency and Bitcoin, with the added beneﬁt of automatic escrow. Using these methods, the Plutus Decentralized Exchange Network (PlutusDEX) of traders convert Bitcoin deposits into a prepaid debit balance that is valid at any contact- 
less point-of-sale (POS) terminal. 
The philosophy of the application itself is open, inclusive and committed to the network health and widespread usage of Bitcoin. As such, a public trading API will be available, and 3rd party development 
is encouraged. 
1 The Ecosystem 
Bitcoin merchant adoption has thus far proved to be a challenging endeavor. Merchants are hesitant to accept it, and users are unable to spend it. Because there is no widespread Bitcoin point-of-sale (POS) infrastructure currently in place, merchants often re- consider accepting Bitcoin due to its perceived com- plexity, which may increase labor costs in the short run, because of the extra employee training required. 
adoption, consumers immediately gain both local and international opportunities for spending the digital currency at physical locations. The Plutus ecosys- tem can be seen in Figure 1. The chicken-and-the- egg problem is solved through both increased user and merchant adoption, because of Plutus vastly im- proved ease-of-use, lowered costs, and greater eﬃ- ciency for merchants, in both the long run and the short run. 
In many cases, they stop accepting Bitcoin or become

frustrated with early technical diﬃculties. These dif- ﬁculties often lead to narrowing merchant adoption of Bitcoin and the blockchain infrastructure in gen- eral. This creates a kind of chicken-and-the-egg prob- lem, which contributes to forcing merchant-side Bit- coin payment processors to signiﬁcantly limit their expansion and adoption eﬀorts. 
This is the crux of the problem which makes Plutus an optimal use case and ideal app for miners, en- trepreneurs, freelancers and anyone else who earns Bitcoin. By avoiding the need to wait for merchant 
Plutus relies heavily on distributed computing and in- corporates connections to the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, as well as the traditional debit card infras- tructure. As such, it is a hybrid system with both centralized and decentralized network components. 
The structure of the Plutus Internal Infrastructure (Figure 2) relies on several interconnected servers and modules. The mobile app itself connects via Se- cure Sockets Layer (SSL) end-to-end encryption to

the Plutus app server, which in turn communicates with the other network servers. The Bitcoin track- ing server reads transaction data contained in the header of each block broadcast onto the Bitcoin net- work to conﬁrm when payments have been completed. Plutons are divisible and tradable assets created on the Ethereum network. This ensures that all Plutons, whether they are traded or transacted between users, are safely conﬁrmed, and permanently stored on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The PlutusDEX, or DEX, is a dApp (decentralized application) on the Ethereum blockchain which han- dles Bitcoin and Pluton trading and matches orders. Traders can register at http://dex.plutus.it to in- teract with other users on the decentralized exchange to purchase Bitcoins and Plutons using ﬁat moneys, i.e. GBP, USD, or EUR. The dApp parses the data from each traders price and quantity submitted to the exchange. The Bitcoin tracking server monitors the address of each user of the mobile app. As a user deposits Bitcoins onto their mobile app, the amount is instantly matched with the best valued oﬀer from a DEX trader, and the user is sent their rebate reward in the form of Plutons. The DEX trader sends the correct amount of ﬁat currency to the Plutus Escrow, where it is then relayed to the merchants bank and completes the transaction cycle, as shown in Figure 3. 
1. An app user enters an amount of Bitcoin to de- 
posit. The DEX dApp instantly matches the re- 
quest with the best price provided by veriﬁed 
traders on the PlutusDEX platform, along with 
the corresponding Bitcoin and/or Pluton payout 
address. 
1. A Bitcoin or Pluton deposit request is sent to 
the DEX dApp running on the Ethereum 
blockchain via the Plutus internal server. 2. Oﬀers and bids are matched using the DEX 
dApp, resulting in a sale of digital tokens 
for ﬁat currency at the current market rate. 
The DEX dApp sends an event message to 
the app user containing the public address 
of the trader who exchanges the users Bit- 
coin for ﬁat. 
2. The Plutus internal server (centralized) con- 
ﬁrms deposits and transaction details on 
the Bitcoin blockchain, as well as on 
Ethereums blockchain. It then sends the 
event message to the DEX dApp (decentral- 
ized) running on the Ethereum blockchain. 
3. Traders must verify their account and identity on 
the PlutusDEX platform to enable any transfer 
of funds to the Plutus escrow account. A trader 
can then enter trade information (create a bid) 
on the DEX dApp. Traders announce their pay- 
out wallet address in advance, in order to re- 
ceive Bitcoin or Pluton deposits directly from 
app users. 
1. Traders can use any valid Bitcoin address, 
and hold their own private keys. Oﬄine 
wallets and cold storage are recommended. 2. Deposits of ﬁat-currency to Plutus escrow is 
completed via the DEX dApp. Details of 
all trades and deposits are stored on the 
Ethereum blockchain. 
4. Next, the Plutus internal server receives veriﬁca- 
tions from the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains 
of the completed transaction stored within the 
DEX dApp. Funds are immediately deducted 
from the DEX users escrow account and then re- 
leased to the prepaid virtual debit card on the 
mobile app in the selected local currency. 
1. The Virtual Debit Card (VDC) gateway en- 
ables contactless balance creation in GBP, 
USD, and EUR. 
5. The merchant then receives payment authoriza- 
tion via the VDC gateway. Funds in their pre- 
ferred currency are forwarded to the merchants 
bank through the established worldwide debit 
card banking network. 
1. Finally, a transaction conﬁrmation is sent to 
the app which triggers an update to the 
contactless balance for the mobile app user. 
2. The DEX dApp receives blockchain transaction

veriﬁcation via the Plutus tracking server, which interacts with both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Upon conﬁrmation, the DEX dApp marks the transaction as complete. 
1. A notiﬁcation is sent to the Plutus Internal 
Server. 
The PlutusDEX platform, illustrated in Figure 4, consists of two main components: 
1. The PlutusDEX dApp that runs on the Ethereum 
network.

2. Applications that form a bridge between 
Ethereum and the traditional payment in- 
frastructure. 
The PlutusDEX platform features the utilization of Ethereum dApps to execute trades between app users and traders in a peer-to-peer system. The DEX dApp matches bids for Bitcoin and Plutons. The platform itself supports ﬁat deposits and oﬀers traders access to purchase Bitcoin directly from app users. 
2.2 Plutus Mobile App 
The Plutus Mobile App (Figure 5) connects users di- rectly to PlutusDEX traders on the Ethereum net- work. Using the Plutus internal server, the Bitcoin network can be reached using the native Bitcoin API, which is connected to via the Java API (ethereumj), or alternatively, the Javascript API (web3). 
The Plutus Mobile App enables the user to choose among a selection of diﬀerent ﬁat currencies. A vir- tual debit card account can be created in GBP, USD, or EUR, allowing the user to have multiple payment options. 
2.2.1 Plutus App Fee Optimization 
Bitcoin conversion has a fee of between 1-4% (TBD). The fee is deducted from the users’ ﬁat deposit bal- ance before the money is released to their VDC ac- count on the Plutus Mobile App. There are no other fees for using the app and no fee to deposit Plutons on the app obtained from another user externally. Plu- tus pays all transaction costs associated with using the Ethereum network (See Section 2.4.2). Merchants pay their normal debit card payment processing fees. 
2.3 Plutus Payment Process 
The Plutus payment process (Figure 6) consists of two main actions: 
1. The Plutus Mobile App initiates a wireless pay- 
ment to the merchants NFC-enabled payment 
terminal through the user’s NFC-enabled smart- 
phone. 
2. The users VDC payment authorization is sent to 
the merchants payment processor, and once ap- 
proved, the funds are deposited to the merchants

bank account. The user and the merchant, re- spectively, receive conﬁrmation of a successful transaction. 
2.4 Pluton Token Infrastructure 
Plutons are the internal digital asset of Plutus and are issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Pluton trans- actions can be sent and received using the Plutus Mobile App, similarly to Bitcoin. Plutons have the added beneﬁt of zero transaction fees, as well as in- stant transaction conﬁrmations. 
Ownership of Plutons is tied to an Ethereum ac- count. Pluton token source code — running on the production Ethereum network (networkid 1) — acts as a decentralized and distributed ledger of all Plu- ton transactions and the addressed location of every Pluton. The beneﬁts of using Ethereums blockchain is its reliability, underwritten by Ethereums built-in incentives for securing the blockchain. This ensures the continuity, integrity and security of the Pluton ledger. 
The Ethereum network supports near-instant conﬁr- mations of Pluton transactions. According to the lat- 
est data, the average time for a new transaction to be conﬁrmed on the blockchain is approximately 17 seconds. This enables users to convert their digital assets to ﬁat currency in nearly an instant. 
2.4.1 Pluton Rebate System 
Plutus Mobile App users are rewarded with a rebate, at a predetermined rate, of Plutons for every Bitcoin- to-ﬁat exchange they make in order to ﬁll their VDC balance. Plutons can be exchanged for ﬁat currency that is then instantly credited to the users contact- less balance. There is no rebate reward given for ex- changes of Pluton and ﬁat currencies. 
The Pluton Rebate System (Figure 7) is implemented on the Ethereum network and regulated by the DEX. Plutons received as rebate rewards are distributed au- tomatically by the DEX to Plutus Mobile App users. 
There will be 20,000,000 total Plutons in existence. As the trading begins for Plutons on the DEX net- work, the exchange rate, EP, will ﬂuctuate according to market conditions. Its general equation can be described as the amount of Plutons, Pt, required to 
6 

========6========

Figure 7: The Plutus Rebate System 
trade for one Bitcoin, or 
EP = 
Pt 
1BT C 
(1) 
Bid orders for Plutons are made via the trading fron- tend. The PlutusDEX trading API will be open source. It will enable the participation of users on the DEX network once they have been veriﬁed on the frontend. 
Users can buy Plutons, as well as Bitcoin, using the DEX. Plutons earned via rebates can be transferred on the blockchain and have no restrictions on use with in the payment system. Users can transfer Plutons to other users or trade them for ﬁat currency, which is sent to the users VDC balance for in-store purchases. Plutons are implemented as a Transferable Fungibles e.g. sub-currency on Ethereum, using the standard Ethereum API. 
Since rebate rewards are only dispersed when con- verting Bitcoin to ﬁat money we must utilise the vari- 
able exchange rate of, EBT C, Bitcoin to the British Pounds, expressed as 
EBT C = 
1BT C 
TtGBP 
(2) 
where Tt represents the current amount of British Pounds required to purchase one Bitcoin as dictated by the market. 
Let Ti symbolize a single transaction by a single user, worth no more than a maximum value of £30. Mul- tiplying Ti by equation (1) yields the Bitcoin value, Bi, of the given transaction, 
Bi = EBT C ∗ Ti 
(3) 
where Ti ≤ £30. 
The rebate reward rate, R, changes every 24 hours ac- cording to the previous days aggregate Bitcoin trans- action volume, V 
△, expressed as 
 
n V 
△ 
= B△i 
i=1 
(4) 
7 

========7========

where the symbol, △, in the superscript indicates that it represents data from the previous day. The previous days aggregate Bitcoin transaction volume is obtained above by summation of each instance of equation (3) on the previous day. 
The rebate reward rate is determined by an algorithm (Figure 8), where R is a dependent variable to V 
△ 
by adapting and modifying the model of a step function to a non-Boolean use. The indicator function of R is deﬁned as the interval expression, IV △, with the subscript, V 
△ 
, of equation (4), which acts as the interval parameter function of the next days rebate reward rate, deﬁned by the expression 
R := IV △(R) (5) 
The interval parameter function is deﬁned by the variable values of R, which are dependent on the cor- responding range of the previous days Bitcoin trans- action volume, V 
△. 
IV △(R) := {Ri, mi ≤ V 
△ 
≤ Mi 
(6) 
The rebate rate, Ri, in the above expression repre- sents the general structure of the parameters that describe every possible value. Each daily rebate rate, Ri, must diﬀerentiate from the previous days rate,△ 
R , by ±0.01%, while Mi − mi = 0.1BT C at each step. The maximum rebate rate is set at 3% when the daily volume is 5 BTC or less and 1% when the daily volume is 25 BTC or more. Thus, each daily increase in volume of 0.1 BTC will reduce the rebate rate by 0.01%, and vice-versa. 
The PlutusDEX dApp calculates the previous 24hr Bitcoin deposit volume on the network to determine the rebate amount for the following 24hrs on the app. This data is relayed to the Pluton issuer code and the change is aﬀected immediately. 
Now that the rebate reward rate, R, has been found above, we can ﬁnd the amount of Pluton, Pi, for one users single transaction by multiplying the results of equation (1), equation (3), and the current exchange rate, R△, to ﬁnd 
Pi = EP ∗ Bi ∗ R△ 
(7) 
The rebate reward rate has the delta in its superscript to indicate that it was calculated using the previous days Bitcoin transaction volume as expressed in equa- tion (5). 
Finally, we can calculate the total Pluton dispersed to users for an entire day, Pday, by summation of the results obtained from equation (3) and equation (7) and simplifying to obtain the emission equation: 
 
n 
Pday = R ∗ (Pi ∗ Bi) (8) 
i=1 
2.4.2 Smart Contracts & Functionality 
On the Ethereum blockchain, dApps are regulated by their underlying code, commonly called a smart con- tract. Plutus has several types of interacting contract code, each with an important function. Each instance can be called via the internal infrastructure, the Plu- tus web-application (client side), and/or the Plutus Mobile App. When an instance is called, the result is transmitted, asynchronously, as an Ethereum event. 
These events will handle all Plutus transactions be- tween traders and users; will register new deposits of ﬁat currency; and will regulate the issuance of new Pluton tokens, earned by users as rebates. Ev- ery time a Plutus smart contract is called, a small amount of Ether must be payed as a transaction fee for Ethereum miners. This fee is known as the Gas Price and is paid for by Plutus. 
Each instance of a Plutus smart contract is explained in more detail below. Their interactions are illus- trated in Figure 9: 
ˆ Plutus User Contract: This is created for each user and each trader who register. Users can register through the Plutus Mobile App. Due to Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules, users must identify themselves using the Plutus central ser- vice, or through an external service such as Uport. The user contract itself will contain a limited amount of logic, but it does reference other smart contracts such as PlutusDEX con- tract and the Pluton token contract. 
ˆ PlutusDEX Contract: Enables users to exchange Plutons, ﬁat currency and Bitcoin. Traders can deposit ﬁat money using the Plutus central- ized web-application. After veriﬁcation by the Plutus internal infrastructure, users can trade by directly interacting with the smart contract through the standard client provided by Plutus, or by using a custom client. 
ˆ Pluton Token Contract: Determines the Pluton balance of every user on the Pluton network and

uses the standard Ethereum API where appli- cable. Users can view their balance and create Pluton transactions using a wallet that supports the transferable fungibles standard, through the plutons.sol ABI deﬁnition. For example: see Mist Wallet 0.3.5 (Beta 3) release. 
ˆ Plutus Issuer Contract: Regulates the amount 
of Plutons issued as rebate rewards for Plutus 
users. The contract uses the process detailed in 
Section 2.4.1. Rewards are based on the amount 
of Bitcoin that a user trades for ﬁat currency 
each day. Only Plutus central can issue rebates. 
ˆ Name Registry Contract: Holds the addresses 
of all active Plutus smart contracts, and allows 
other smart contracts to call it to return spe- 
ciﬁc addresses on the Ethereum blockchain. See 
namereg.sol for example code. 
ˆ VDC gateway connects to the Plutus app. 
– VDC providers API enables users to gener- 
ate a single virtual debit card token for each 
selected currency (GBP, USD & EUR). – A Plutus app account only allows one VDC 
account per currency. Each new deposit 
will be added to the same VDC account. 
ˆ VDC gateway connection to NFC device. 
– Plutus app user initiates a purchase cycle, 
by contacting the merchants NFC-enabled 
POS terminal (contactless card reader). – The mobile devices built-in NFC capa- 
bility is used to send the VDC token- 
authorization code to the merchants pay- 
ment processor or bank. 
and how they interact can be found in Section 4. Plutus smart contracts are being actively de- veloped as open source software viewable on the Plutus Github. Readers are encouraged to comment or supply patches to the source code.

2.5 Virtual Debit Card Gateway 
A DEX trader transfers ﬁat funds to the Plutus es- crow account prior to entering trade information. Only the Plutus virtual debit card gateway applica- tion can release the ﬁat balance to a virtual debit card token. This is a secure token used for authorization, which is sent to the merchant’s payment processor via the NFC mobile device. The ﬁat amount is re- leased to the merchants bank-account via the debit card payment network, once the trade has been com- pleted. 
The app user preloads his VDC using Bitcoin. The request is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ren- dering it transparent and decentralized. This request is handled by the DEX, which sends the traders pay- out address to the Plutus Mobile App. The app then transfers Bitcoin directly to the payout address pro- vided by the trader. 
Since public addresses of traders are published on blockchains, and therefore known to the Plutus plat- form, the Plutus platform can verify that the amount transferred to the traders accounts is correct before releasing the ﬁat balance accordingly. The VDC- provider receives the ﬁat amount and loads balance to the customers VDC. 
The app is designed for small day to day payments only. It has a deposit limit for diﬀerent account types and a per transaction limit of £30 in the UK (min- imum transaction limit changes according to loca- tion). Users will be advised to only deposit what they wish to spend. In case of user error where the deposit amount is more or less than the requested amount, the smart contract will notify Plutus of the anomaly and fund the users VDC account accordingly. 
Note: Traders receiving deposits have veriﬁed identi- ties using KYC/AML procedures and have ﬁat funds secured in escrow. There is a minimum balance limit for traders on the DEX to protect against anomalies linking to incorrect deposit amounts.
