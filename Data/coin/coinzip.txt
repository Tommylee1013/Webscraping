1. Introduction 
April 26th | T​his day now marks two revolutions in freight, 60 years apart. The first was in 1956 with the launch Malcom McLean’s shipping container introducing the era of modern container shipping.2 On April 26th, 2016 we launched Blockfreight™ the blockchain of global freight introducing the era of distributed automation, audit and settlement. 
The genesis block of a new era for the digital security, trust, authentication, record keeping and chain of custody data associated with each movement of global freight. 
Where the introduction of shipping containers reduced costs and increased the speed of international trade3, so too will transaction containers of data on the Blockfreight™ network.

Blockfreight™ is an open network blockchain allowing stakeholders to have access to an advanced global ledger and just like the ISO 668 container before it, this is a global trade optimisation technology. 
The Blockfreight™ network solves the inefficiency and variability in the data associated with each and every movement of container freight.

Value add applications on top of our stack. Built by individuals with permissionless, innovation or by companies and stakeholder development teams and independent software vendors (ISVs) who build a businesses on top of the Blockfreight™ network. The Blockfreight™ blockchain of global freight. 
Built on the example of the Bitcoin peer-to-peer electronic cash system4​, the core prior art example of the practical embodiment of an openly participatory network and blockchain. 
Where Bitcoin is deliberately designed and well suited to the application of peer-to-peer money/electronic cash. Blockfreight™ deliberately designed and well suited to the needs of the international shipping of cargo freight. 
In an open blockchain such as Blockfreight™ stakeholders participate in the scaling of the network. This participation is in the form of scaling the data security and management of the application stack by participating in the validation and distribution of its content.

Blockfreight R&D 
Blockfreight™ begins life as a research and development project. The past year was spent on developing the system design and researching options for the underlying technology stack through commercial research and development by ​I​B​lockfreight R&D (Australia) resulting in the Blockfreight™ Open Source (MIT) project ​II​https://github.com/blockfreight​. 
Blockfreight™ Open Source Project 
The codebase posted at Github is Open Source (MIT) licensed for all network participants and developers within the freight community to collaborate on and communicate around. If you are interested in developing on Blockfreight™ network simply email [s​upport@blockfreight.com​] and join our #Slack Channel @ b​lockfreight.slack.com​. 
Blockfreight Inc 
The Blockfreight™ network fee, anti-spam measure is based on the ​V​BLOCKFREIGHT.XCP software access token. ​IV​Blockfreight Inc manages the licensing of sales of BLOCKFREIGHT.XCP software access tokens. The availability of ​VI​BLOCKFREIGHT.XCP is commercially managed support the business and early token sales will be made available to interested parties at a discount on the standard full retail price of USD $1 / BLOCKFREIGHT.XCP. 
The Blockfreight™ network is open by design and open by participation in the network’s rules of governance which are set by the market demands and practical realities of freight as expressed by validator nodes in consensus voting on network for rule adoption and changes. 
In an open blockchain such as Blockfreight™ stakeholders participate in the scaling of the network. This participation is in the form of scaling the data security and

management of the application stack by participating in the validation and distribution of its content. 
Blockfreight™ Token Sales 
Token sales can be conducted by the company or any licensee or agent. The Blockfreight™ [BFT:XCP] tokens | Open of availability commenced Jun 1, 2016. 
Blockfreight™ Token 
The Blockfreight™ [BFT:XCP] tokens are the network fee to put a transaction onto the blockchain. BLOCKFREIGHT.XCP is an asset on the Counterparty platform which is built on the Bitcoin digital currency network. 
Licensed Sales 
Blockfreight Inc will license sales of Blockfreight™ token. 
Token Exchanges 
Many exchanges exist around the world where Blockfreight™ [ BFT:XCP ] tokens may be offered or exchanged for Bitcoin, Dollars, Euro, Yuan (RMB) or Yen. (Secondary market). 
APIs 
Validators on the network may be closed or open to requests via web based web APIs 
3rd Party App 
Many companies and applications may be layered on the Blockfreight™ network and blockchain. This app economy will serve the industry and consumers. 
Partner Networks 
A merkle hash of the Bitcoin network is included in the Blockfreight™ blockchain, on average every six (6) blocks. 
Partner platforms & SaaS 
Software designed for industry and consumers can grow on the Blockfreight™ blockchain. 
Validator & Node 
The Blockfreight™ blockchain does not mine but rather relies on a peer-network of bonded-stake validators which also act as network nodes. Nodes participate in voting network rules into consensus. Validator bond stake into the network and will be entitled to receive a share of network fee.

========6========

JSON ruleset 
The Blockfreight™ blockchain transaction (TX) is defined within the JSON ruleset for the network available and published at our GitHub account. 
Ethereum Smart Contracts 
The Blockfreight™ transaction (TX) may reference an ethereum smart contract. 
Blockfreight™ network & blockchain 
The Blockfreight™ network is a peer-to-peer gossip network for broadcasting and transmitting unconfirmed transactions (TX) and transfer of Blockfreight™ blockchain blocks. 
IPFS 
Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) is a permanent file system to reference any store of transaction binary data. 
b. Application and network structure 
An overview of the Blockfreight™ network components: 
[ Validator ] [ Application ] [ Blockchain ] 
Validators: ​Act as nodes5, validate transactions, vote on rules, provide API services Application: ​Defines TX rules-set [Blockfreight™ reference client available for download at https://blockfreight.com/download​Distributed in OSX, Windows Server and LINUX installs. Blockchain: D​istributed ledger of all valid and included TX 
c. Related work - From Bitcoin to ISO standards 
Blockfreight™ is preceded by a significant body work in the technology space. Most notably Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System​4​as a practical example and application of network systems using proof-of-work to provide a level of Byzantine fault tolerant within a consensus network. The Bitcoin blockchain and digital currency is a fundamental building block and network primitive of the Blockfreight™ network. 
After the release and operation of the Bitcoin network an extension to the electronic cash application for Bitcoin was created by Counterparty6 in 2014 in the form of an open assets distributed financial exchange platform. The Blockfreight™ token (Blockfreight™ network fee) is a asset issued on the Counterparty protocol ​BLOCKFREIGHT.XCP

========7========

Another project adding utility in the form of a platform for distributed execution of applications (contracts) is the Ethereum7 network introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. The early specifications and network development work was undertaken in 2014 with the support of a crowdfunding token sale in August of that same year. By early 2015 the test network was in release and the initial Frontier release was launched by July. By 2016 the network is in Homestead release with a live smart-contracting platform which has met with strong interest and attracted an active and engaged community of both developer and commercial interest. The progress on delivery of a stable environment affords inclusion of an Ethereum based smart-contracts layer within the Blockfreight™ specification so as to allow Blockfreight™ to reference applications (contracts) running on the Ethereum network. 
In order to draw on the relative strengths of these platforms (Bitcoin network, Counterparty protocol and Ethereum network) the design of the Blockfreight™ blockchain of global freight requires flexibility and the ability to define the network specific rules and data structures. We sought to employ a modular ruleset and to ensure we allow the protocol to evolve over time. These attributes were offered in our selection of Tendermint8. The Tendermint project has been the core technology underpinning Eris Industries consensus layer9. 
One of the goals of Blockfreight™ is to define a standard for blockchain freight data. Specifically drawing upon the ANSI EDI Standards10 for data exchange and the work of GS1 ASN11 around standards for Bill of Lading payload. It is envisaged that industry participation in standards definition, potentially including application to ISO standardisation should form part of the remit for this project. Our aim is to consult with standards making bodies to ensure wide adoption and clear definition of the Blockfreight™ protocol is achieved. 
d. Key concepts of the Blockfreight™ network 
It is proposed that with the introduction of Blockfreight™ as the blockchain of global freight we will witness and enable a number of application and services for the global supply chain to be built on top of the network which allow a new era of efficiencies through automation of markets and resource allocation to be introduced. These applications around automation and efficiency may take full advantage smart-contracts afforded by the Blockfreight™ network. 
The data within the Blockfreight™ blockchain reflects the agreed common state which attains network consensus and thereby serves as an incontrovertible record.

========8========

Blockfreight™ is smart contract enabled and smart contract controlled. Development of participation rules to address security, the governance framework & governance systems is the core challenge for the development team and network participants during the evolution of Blockfreight™ network. 
d. Blockfreight™ [BFT:XCP] network fee 
A vital piece of the economic bedrock of the Blockfreight™ network is the inclusion of a network fee. A Blockfreight™ token [BFT:XCP] is required for each TX included in the chain. 
Absent this charge, a “Free” or no charge systems give rise to an incentive for capturing end user data for analytics, targeting and resale and encourages closed systems of centralised control. By contrast the Blockfreight™ blockchain is an open network operated by peers in a distributed consensus model with payload data available exclusively to parties to a transaction. 
Another core benefits of a paid network is that it provides a clearly defined revenue stream to support the operational costs of consumables and infrastructure, development and allows for sponsorship and coordination of a community of innovators to work on scaling the APIs and network features of the Blockfreight™ network over time. 
While it is true that a participatory architecture reduces cost where the community of users participate in the scaling of the architecture and fabric of the network there still needs to be a way to address the needs of support, development and advocacy functions through time in a sustainable way.

4. Blockfreight™ goals 
Image:​Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow (Epcot) Center, Orlando Florida | Copyright © Walt Disney World Resort 
Like the pyramid fabric in this structure of the image above, one key characteristic of a blockchains are the interlocking and mathematically (cryptographic) signed data sets form an integrity structure acting as the self-evidence of structural validity as measured by the ruleset applied to them and as determined by the signing parties assuming shared consensus around specific rulesets. 
With Blockfreight™ the blockchain of global freight we unlock the opportunity for new and innovative applications serving the needs of the global supply chain to emerge. Delivering a robust open platform on which to built automation, audit and market based systems. 
Blockfeight Inc will actively invest in early-stage startups through the Blockfreight Innovation Fund (BIF) to seed development of interesting, impactful and scalable use-case applications of Blockfreight™ network.

========10========

5. Blockfreight™ consensus network 
a. Validation 
A validator on the Blockfreight™ network is also a node. Providing transaction review, validation and transmission to peers. 
b. Agreement (Voting) 
The ruleset of the network is set by the network participants in a round of voting. 
These consensus rules form the basis of validation of transaction and allowing (or denying) them entry to the Blockfreight™ blockchain. 
c. Utility 
A blockchain of global freight allows reliance on the record of account as an immutable digital record. This unlocks the opportunity for value added applications such as performance based smart-contracts and chain of custody record managment and compliance systems to be built.

6. Discussion 
1. Will it scale?​Tendermint allows for 10k TX/sec with a block rate as high as 1 
block/sec. We should be able to accommodate immediate and future needs. Moving 
to commercial implementation will afford more opportunity for empirical testing 
metrics. 
2. Does it need Bitcoin? Y​es. Both for the network fee [BLOCKFREIGHT.XCP] which is 
a Counterparty asset, and for the merkle root chain hashing (on average every 10 
Bitcoin blocks) providing audit locking and validation for chain-of-custody 
chain-of-record data sets. Openstack permissionless. 
3. Is it Open Source?​Yes. We release all code under an Open Source (MIT) license. 4. What data goes into a TX?​The primary payload of a Blockfreight™ transaction is a 
an electronic Bill of Lading (BoL). This is a document generated by a shipping line 
whose purpose is to document ownership and facilitate transfer of ownership 
between seller and buyer. It is one of the most important commercial documents. It 
is by definition tied to payment. 
5. Why a BoL?​The BoL document is accepted as proof of ownership by banks and 
facilitates payment settlement. For example a swap of BoL is done by banks in the 
Letter of Credit (LoC), Documents against Payment (DoP), or TT against copy of 
documents in more trusted transactions. 
6. Who are likely to form the interested parties of a consensus block? ​The three 
parties who might require an improved solution are buyers (Walmart), sellers 
(Li&Fung), and banks (HSBC). The solution (platform) is to create a middleware that 
allows those parties to interact. They will demand enterprise standards based 
software. 
7. Why not build on a private Ethereum blockchain running on Azure to integrate 
with R3’s 42 banks, and Project ConsenSys (Deloitte) at same time seek buy in 
from logistics industry? T​here is no barrier to our code being transferred into a 
project like this and we will support any ISV in the space choosing to experiment or 
build a solution with Etherium at it's core. Blockfreight™ is chaining to the Bitcoin 
blockchain at it's core.

Open Fund Management Platform to disrupt the investment industry 
Tim M. Zagar, Jani Valjavec, Zenel Batagelj, Ervin U. Kovac, Ales Lekse 
The crises of our time, it becomes increasingly clear, are the necessary impetus for the revolution  
now under way. And once we understand nature's transformative powers, we see that it is our  
powerful ally, not a force to feared our subdued. (Thomas Kuhn) 
July 2016

WHY INVEST IN ICONOMI? 
ICONOMI is about disruption  - the “uberisation” of fund management . We are pairing  
the business-model fundamentals of the crypto -world and the obvious trend of platform  
domination with new technological possibilities.  
Internet, Facebook, Android, Uber  - those are all the big stories where it was impossible  
to  invest  at  the  early  stages  of  development.  It  was  either  technically  not  possible  (for  
example with the Internet) or it was only reserved for “big investors”, who in turn reaped  
all the high profits.  
We believe that  blockchains  are game-changers for the investment  world, linking those  
with disruptive ideas directly to those looking for investing opportunities, no matter the  
skill level or size of investment. Now it is possible to invest in disruptive technologies at  the 
very early stages. 
ICONOMI’s mission is to provide an opportunity for investors looking for  high profits,  
not possible in the old economy . It will do so through a simple and trustworthy entry point,  
providing them with excellent experience, which is crucial for keeping them  investing in  
the new economy. With your help, ICONOMI will bring an influx of fresh c apital into the  
distributed economy, providing funding for exciting new projects and boosting the value  
of digital assets along the way . 
ICONOMI is creating the  missing link between the old and the new economy.  Speaking  
the language of the old economy and acting by the principles of the new one, ICONOMIs  
transparent management will be provided by an EU legislation compliant and regulated  
service operator. 
Our timeline is am bitious - our journey already started in Q1 2016, when we first began  
offering Ether and learning what clients are missing. In Q3 2016 we will finalise the required  
infrastructure and in Q4 2016 we will introduce the first two ICONOMI investment funds. 
2017  will  be  dedicated  to  our  vision.  We  will  launch  the  ICONOMI Open  Fund  
Management  platform  with  a  simple  promise  to  successful  traders  - anyone  can  be  a  
professional fund manager;  “You bring the crypto-expertise, we take care of everything  
else”. 
2 

========2========

ICONOMI will open up a new financial services category in the decentralised economy,  
with a guaranteed income stream and an ambitious platform vision. We are positive that  
ICONOMI is one of the most appealing business proposals of 2016 with its  high probability  
of investment multiplication.

1 
CREATION OF NEW FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
ICONOMI will launch the ICONOMI Open Fund Management platform  (OFM) and two  
types  of  new  financial  instruments:  the  ICONOMI  Coin  Traded  Fund  (CTF)  and  the  
ICONOMI Coin Managed Fund (CMF). 
1.1 
Open Fund Management (OFM) platform 
The  essence  and  vision  of  the  ICONOMI  project  is  the  ICONOMI  Open  Fund  
Management  (OFM)  platfo rm  for  investing.  OFM  is  a  simple  management  tool  where  
traders with knowledge and experience create their own investment funds. Investors, on  
the other hand, are able to invest even the smallest amounts, getting a clear overview of  
available investment fu nd managers and their current & past performance. The ICONOMI  
Open Fund Management (OFM) platform will disrupt the asset management industry. 
ICONOMI OFM platform’s promise is short: “You manage the funds, we take care of  
everything else” 
• 
We bring the investors - at the time of OFM platform introduction, the ICONOMI  
platform will already have a large base of ICONOMI CTF and CMF investors . 
• 
The OFM platform systematically enables the sharing of management fees between  
fund managers and investors with Ethereum smart contract utilisation. 
• 
The OFM platform will feature numerous easy to use tools, such as the portfolio  
management tool, market data analysis tool, market forecast and history and much  
more. 
1.2 
Coin Traded Fund (CTF) 
CTFs will be managed automatically ba sed on predetermined rules and will be inherently  
transparent. Their behaviour will respond to market developments, making the individual  
coin percentages in the funds dependent on preordained rules and changes on the market.  
Our analytical services will c onstantly monitor several market parameters, continuously  
analyse available market data, build detailed market forecasts and adapt investment funds  
as needed, within preset limits.  
Investors  will  benefit  from  lower  risks,  which  are  going  to  be  mitigated  with  careful  
preselection  of  included  tokens  of  value,  and  lower  price  volatility.  Since  CTFs  will  be  
continuously tradable, they will be attractive to investors who are looking to buy and sell  

========5========

units of the fund (tokens) i n a matter of seconds. Daily liquidity of CTFs on the market is  
going to be guaranteed by market makers, who, by exploiting arbitrage opportunities, will  
be pushing the prices of CTFs to their net asset value. 
1.3 
Coin Managed Fund (CMF) 
CMFs will be activel y managed by a team of experts  - financial analysts, mathematicians  
and  cryptocurrency  community  professionals.  Veterans  of  their  respective  fields,  with  
decades  of  experience  and  successful  projects  behind  them,  they  will  help  hone  the  
ICONOMI spear for attack on the markets, making the ICONOMI CMF funds one of the  
most  profitable  financial  instruments.  With  possibility  of  return  on  investment  
multiplication, CMF funds will represent our highest risk investment opportunities. 
2 
ICONOMI INVESTMENT FUNDS 
Both  CTF  and  CMF  ICONOMI  funds  offer  significant  advantages  over  traditional  
investment funds.  
• 
Each ICONOMI investment fund will issue its  own tokens. CTFs will be offered to  
all major exchanges, therefore expect them to be found (traded) there. CMFs will  
be tradable only within ICONOMI. 
• 
ICONOMI funds will be hyper-liquid and accessible 24/7 via the ICONOMI debit  
card when kept on the ICONOMI platform. 
• 
ICONOMI  investment  funds  will  establish  new  ground-breaking standards  in  
transparency - all aspects of fund management will be accessible at all times.  
ICONOMI will introduce two investment funds: the CTF type ICONOMI.INDEX FUND  
and the CMF type ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE FUND. 
2.1 
ICONOMI.INDEX FUND 
The ICONOMI.INDEX FUND will  reflect the development of a credible crypto currency  
market. As a CTF fund it will be transparently managed and traded on major exchanges.  
The ICONOMI.INDEX fund will include several thoroughly -researched cryptocurrencies,  
including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lisk, Steem and other major value tokens. 
A carefully  chosen  package  of  undervalued  assets,  stripped  of  the  risks  associated  with  
acquiring and storing the assets yourself, the ICONOMI index fund is perfect for instantly  
6 

========6========

creating  a  well-balanced  portfolio  of  cryptocurrencies,  while  still  enjoying  signif icantly  
higher profits than with any other existing financial instruments. 
2.2 
ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE FUND 
The ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE FUND will aim at  high performance  - multiplication  
of investment. As a CMF it will be actively managed by a team of ICONOMI experts. Our  
team will scout for propitious early investment ICO opportunities (crowdfunded startup  
projects and companies). Through our company -focused fund, everyone can become a  
venture capitalist, without any of the hassle and capital requirements.  
In  order  to  ensure  the  best  possible  management  and  prevent  the  possibility  of  
oversubscription, the ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE fund will be  by invitation only.  
ICONOMI ICO participants will be invited to join the ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE fund! 
3 
ICONOMI PLATFORM DETAILS 
The ICONOMI platform envisioned in this white paper is meant to exist autonomously  
after development completion. Being a crowdfunded project, a majority of 85 % will be  
owned by the crowdfunding participants in the form of ICONOMI tokens (“ICN”), while  
a share of 15 % ICNs will be reserved for the original development team, advisors, bounties  
and the earliest adopters/contributors. Possessing the required prerequisites, Cashila OOD  
s.r.o. will serve as the first ICONOMI service operator. It will do so without part icipation  
in profit-sharing, financing itself only from the capital raised through the crowdfunding  
campaign. 
3.1 
ICONOMI Crowdfunding - Initial Coin Offering 
The capital required for development and release of the ICONOMI platform will be secured  
through a crowdfunding campaign - ICONOMI Initial Coin Offering (hereinafter referred  
to as “ICO”). 10 days after the conclusion of the ICO, ICONOMI will issue 100 mil lion  
ICONOMI tokens. ICONOMI tokens will be Ethereum -based tokens of value (see below). 
ICO will be open to everyone between  25. 8. 2016 8:00 UTC and 29. 9. 2016 20:00 UTC.  
During this time, a special ICONOMI ICO website will be available at  
ico.iconomi.net  
where ICO participants will be able to generate user accounts. ICONOMI ICO website

will guide participants thought the deposit process. Several fiat and crypto currencies will  
be accepted - for details regarding the deposits please see our FAQ. 
10  days  after  the  funding  campaign  is  completed,  the  number  of  ICONOMI  tokens  
belonging to each ICO participant will be determined based on the total amount raised and  
the ICONOMI tokens transferred to individual user accounts. Should the crowdfunding  
campaign fail to reach its capital goal of 2000 BTC or equivalent , all funds will be returned. 
3.2 
ICONOMI Tokens (ICN) 
ICONOMI will issue 100 milion ICONOMI tokens (ICN) 10 days after the crowdfunding  
campaign successfully ends. 100 % of the ICONOMI tokens represent 100 % ownership of  
the ICONOMI platform, comprising of all assets and liabilities, as well as each and every  
right and obligation, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, branding and  
trademarks.  
ICN will be an Ethereum-based token of value. Tokens are a digital asset, bearing value  
by  themselves  based  on  their  underlying  assets,  properties  and/or  rights.  ICN  tokens  
represent ownership of the ICONOMI platform, allowing their holders to receive dividends  
and vote on ICONOMI related issues. 
While  Bitcoin  serves  as  an  excellent  example  of  a  successful  token  of  value,  Ethereum  
enables us to easily create much more complex systems with very little entry costs. Ethereum  
based tokens rely on a well -established Ethereum infrastructure, benefiting from several  
advantages: 
1. security  and  predictability 
(as  opposed  to,  for  example,  having  to  run  an  
independent blockchain network);  
2. use of robust and well - supported clients (Ethereum- based tokens can be managed  
with official Ethereum clients):  
3. high liquidity (interchangeable with other Ethereum - based tokens or Ether);  
4. easier listing on exchanges with infrastructure already in place;  
5. Ethereum  smart  contracts  enable  a  very  transparent  and  secure  way  of  profit - 
sharing among the token holders.

3.3 
ICONOMI Technical Details 
All non-fiat funds sent during the ICO will be immediately  — with the next block after  
they  are  received  — sent  to  a  cold-storage,  multi-signature  address.  Ether  will  be  
transferred automatically by a smart contract already developed and tested with the cu rrent  
iconomi.net platform. Private keyholders will be announced before the ICO starts and will  
include several well-known, independent individuals from the crypto community.  
In order to gain access to the assets acquired during the ICO, a sufficient time from the  
issuance of ICNs will have to pass. What is more, independent multisig signatories will have  
to approve the transfer. The ICONOMI team will not hold the number of private keys  
required to gain access to the funds.  
ICNs will be issued with the deployment of a smart contract on the Ethereum network and  
transferred to an Ethereum address users will be able to provide through the ICONOMI  
interface. Users who fail to do so will still be able to access their ICNs via the ICONOMI  
website. 
3.4 
ICONOMI Service Operator 
The service operator of the ICONOMI platform provides a way of materialising the actions  
of  the  autonomous  ICONOMI  platform.  In  the  same  way  that  a  juridical  personality  
manifests  its  actions  through  its  authorised  natural  persons,  the  ICONOMI  p 
latforms  
establishes its relationships with other juridical persons, natural persons and government  
entities through the at-the-time elected service operator. 
Cashila  OOD  s.r.o.  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “Cashila”)  will  serve  as  the  first  service  
operator  of  the  ICONOMI  platform.  Having  at  its  disposal  the  required  knowledge,  
technical skills and manpower, as well as the status of a financial institution and a long - 
standing  relationship  with  both  the  crypto  and  investment  communities,  Cashila  will  
undertake to develop and manage the ICONOMI platform in accordance with the vision  
outlined in this white paper and detailed in the accompanying documentation on behalf of  
the ICN token holders. Cashila does not and will not claim or register any kind of property ,  
trademark or other rights pertaining to the ICONOMI platform. All intellectual property  
rights,  trademarks,  branding  and  other  rights  remain  exclusively  the  property  of  the  
ICONOMI platform.  
9 

========9========

Cashila  will  develop  and  organise  the  ICONOMI  ICO  campaign  on  
behalf  of  the  
ICONOMI platform. Cashila will develop and manage the ICONOMI platform as the first  
service operator. Although a profit -sharing scheme between the ICONOMI platform and  
its service operator is intended to be exercised, Cashila will not partici pate in profit-sharing  
at  least  until  such  time  that  the  capital  raised  during  the  ICONOMI  ICO  covers  the  
operational costs of Cashila. 
ICN ownership entitles its possessor to participate in ICONOMI platform related voting.  
One of the most important voting issues will be the selection of service operators. ICN  
holders are free to vote on a service operator at any time after the ICONOMI platform has  
been launched, but not before a 24 -month moratorium has passed.

Metaverse Project (MVS) 
Metaverse is a decentraliz ed open platform  based on public blockchain technology  that  encompasses  Digital  Assets  and  Digital  Identities.  By  building  a general  technology  platform that  can  be  utilized  by  enterprises  and  individuals ,  Metaverse  digitizes  assets  (conceptually  similar  to  asset  securitization ) such  as  rare  goods (artwork/antiques),  intellectual property, and rights to  returns from financial instruments in order to improve  market efficiency. Through the provision of smart  contracts and digital identities, Metaverse  connects standalone stores of value to form an internet of value . 
MVS hopes to develop iteratively by working closely with businesses . Hence, each version  of MVS will support a different degree of functionality, with successive  updates responsive  to market  feedback.  The  initial  version  of  MVS  will  be  released  with  a  minimal  set  of  operations. This will subsequently be expanded using Bitcoin as the foundation to provide  additional functions such as Digital Identity and Digital Ass ets. 
The  software  of  Metaverse  is  distributed  under  the  terms  of  the  AGPL3.0  licensing  agreement and  is developed and maintained by Viewfin’s development team. Metaverse  will be releasing its source code  for open source development at: https://github.com/mvs - org/metaverse

,O- 
Blockchain  technology  originate d from  the  Bitcoin  system.  Because  of  the  technology’s  decentralized nature and its immutable ledger, Bitcoin  provides a solution for problems such  as trading fraud and double spending.  It is widely believed to be the first application of  blockchain technology. 
Bitcoin is a sophisticated online payment system first invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, who  defined Bitcoin as a Peer -to-Peer Electronic Cash System. In the past seven years,  despite the initial misgivings, Bitcoin has ascended to prominence and now boasts a market cap of  over USD $100 billion. 
Many acknowledge that bitcoin is not just a new cash system; it also  possesses blockchain  attributes and guarantees the security of its distributed ledger via blockchain technology.  More importantly, Bitcoin convincingly proved that physical assets can and will be digitized.  As a decentralized system, blockchain uses cryptography to maintain an immutable ledger,  allowing all parties  to freely transfer  value  and  conduct  transactions in  a trust-free environment. This has wide-ranging implications for industries such as banking, insurance,  healthcare, logistics and media . 
,MEAB2EOMSB-EI 
The development of blockchain technology and its concepts  follow the deconstruction and  reconstruction of the Bitcoin system. Namecoin and Peercoin made  landmark contributions  in the process of moving from cryptocurrencies to the blockchain concept, while Bitshares  and Ethereum  furthered our understanding of the blockchain. 
• Namecoin and Peercoin 
Namecoin is the first application  forked from Bitcoin. It was designed and implemented to  add the concept of “decentralized domain name” to Bitcoin’s original electronic cash system  (this can be considered the predecessor of digital identities). Namecoin also introduced  merged mining, allowing the simultaneous mining of Namecoin and Bitcoin to guarantee  the security of the node network. 
If all blockchains needed to design a new Proof -of-Work (PoW) algorithm , or shared a PoW algorithm with known  mining centralization issues and had to deploy mining hardware as  full nodes in the network, blockchain technology would lag years behind its curr ent state of  development. Peercoin came up with a different consensus mechanism,  the well-known  Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm. The release of the PoS algorithm created a low -cost way  to  develop  blockchains,  leading  to  large  numbers  of  new  blockchain  attem pts.  Micro- innovations  of  the  consensus  mechanism also  continuously  drove  the  development  of  blockchain technology.

Bitshares

consensus protocol. Bitshares constantly put forward new concepts  such as Keyhotee, a  project that gave digital identity more prominence. Furthermore, it introduced multiple type s  of transactions to simplify  asset registration and issuance . Crucially, Bitshares introduced  a Decentralized Asset Exchange . To provide a better user experience, it modified its block  creation rate to be one every few seconds; however this came at the sacrifice of some  system stability.   
• Ethereum 
Unlike Peercoin and Bitshares, Ethereum uses the PoW  consensus protocol to secure its  network in its early stages and will transition to a PoS  consensus protocol by forking. This  design primarily considers the system’s safety during its initial stages . In addition, Ethereum  implemented the concept of smart contracts, its most important contribution apart from  its  enhancement of block  creation  characteristics and reward  mechanisms.  Through smart  contracts and its specially -developed EVM, Ethereum expanded the range of transaction  types that could be handled by blockchains, with the downside that all transaction types on  Ethereum must be implemented in the form of contracts. 
• Public and Permissioned Blockchain s 
The difference between public and permissioned blockchain s lies mainly in their attitude  towards nodes and their scope of trust. Public blockchains have a low threshold for node  access and generally treat all nodes as not credible , hence some certification mechanism  (PoW,  PoS  or  their  variants)  is  required to  select  the  node  responsible  for  recording  a  transaction. On the other hand, permissioned blockchains only  grant access to whitelisted  nodes, and may establish a strict firewal l. Therefore, a public blockchain’s trust mechanism  is targeted at the general public and has a broad scope  – all parties who use the public  blockchain or record transactions on it are within the scope of trust. However, permissioned  blockchains only trust permissioned nodes and hence have relatively small scopes of trust .

Blockchain Roadmap 
 
 
 

========6========

 
Bitcoin, Bitshares and Ethereum are currently in the digital currency/digital notarization,  decentralized exchange, and decentralized organization stages respectively.  Looking at the  current  status  of  blockchains  today  as  illustrated  above,  it  is  clear  tha t  blockchain  technology  is  still  developing.  Hence,  our  goal  of  building  a  blockchain  ecosystem  containing  diverse  applications  built  on  a  value  transmission  network  featuring  a  comprehensive basic infrastructure layer still requires a gargantuan effort.

The term ‘Metaverse’ first appeared in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash ,  where  humans  controlled  avatars in  a  virtual  reality  world  known  as  the  Metaverse. Through  avatars, one could interact and form relationships with other electronic agents. 
Modern life is just like the world described  by Neal Stephenson’s novel. As our work and life  become increasingly dependent on the Internet, people spend more time online rather than offline.  The way people communicate has also changed, with communication occurring more often and  at higher intensity. I n the near future, we foresee a transition from the internet of information to  the internet of value: an increasing number of digital assets transfers will  take place online, and Avatars (Digital Identities) and intermediary Oracles  will become the new mainstream economic  model. 
The name Metaverse Project was inspired by Neal Stephenson’s Metaverse.

• ETP 
The token used by Metaverse is called ETP. A total of 100 million ETP will be issued through a  combination of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and PoW mining; similar to Bitcoin, the smallest unit of  ETP is 1 x 10-8 ETP. ETP can be transferred and traded on Metaverse , and will be an important  factor  used  to  determine who  gets  to  mint  a block  after  Metaverse  transitions  to  the  PoS  consensus protocol. The security of ETP  will be guaranteed by the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital  Signature Algorithm). 
ETP  is  not  a  new  form  of  digital  currency  – instead,  it  represents  the rights  and  interests of  Metaverse.  Hence, the price of ETP will not be anchored on any  fiat money or cryptocurrency  such as Bitcoin, but will depend on the demand for ETP as well as the development of Metaverse’s  ecosystem. 
ETP will be used to measure the value of smart properties in Metaverse or as collateral in financial  transactions. Additionally, fees applied on Metaverse (to create new smart properties, register a  new Avatar, designate yourself as an Oracle or invite trusted institutions to verify assets and  identities on Metaverse) must be paid in ETP. 
• ETP Distribution Mechanism 
(1) ICO and community building 
In the blockchain industry, ICOs are common and are the default method of token distribution.  In January 2014, Bitshares launched an ICO lasting 200 days. Ethereum launched an ICO  which raised a staggering 25,000 Bitcoin in July 2014 ; DigixDAO, Lisk and the controversial  The  DAO  project  that  followed  all launched  their  ICOs in  2016.  Domestically,  NEO  also  successfully  crowdfunded 2,100 and 6,119 Bitcoins in October 2015 and September 2016  respectively. 
Metaverse Project has distributed 2 5 million ETP in its first Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Another 25 million ETP will be used to set up the Metaverse Foundation to support blockchain ICO  projects that benefit the Metaverse community, facilitate investment activities that  enhance  Metaverse’s ecosystem a nd reward major contributors to the community. 
(2) PoW and PoS mining 
Additionally,  about  30  million  ETP  will  be  distributed  as  block  rewards through  the  PoW  mechanism to those who help maintain Metaverse’s system , through a process known as  mining. 
The block difficulty of Metaverse will adjust to match the network’s computing power. The

targeted block generation time is 24 seconds; the actual block time at the time of this writing  is 33 seconds. The initial reward for mining each block is 3 ETP and block rewards decrease  by  5%  every  500,000  blocks .  Hence,  setting  block  time  and  block  reward  as  standard  parameters, we can obtain 1) a graph showing amount of ETP mined against time in years,  and 2) the decay diagram of the total reward obtained  every 500,000 blocks against time in  years.

(3) Coinlock and Coinlock  Rewards 
Metaverse incorporated a paid coinlock function  at the system level while designing ETP’s  economic model. This design is the first of its kind  – it can be thought of as the tokenization  of coin age, and it paves the way for a PoS-based economic model  in the future as well as  financial applications derived from the coinlock function.  
 
 
 

========10========

 
To obtain ETP rewards, users must take the initiative to use the coinlock function. This reward will  be  sent together  with  the  principal  amount to  the  user’s  coinlock  address  through  a  coinbase transaction once the locking period ends. 
Reward details are specified below: 
H + block height 
25,200 
108,000 
Reward rate 
0.10% 
0.67% 
• 
331,200 
655,200 
1,314,000 
3.20% 
8.00% 
20.00% 
H + block height : Assuming the current block height is ‘H’, users  must lock their ETP for 25,200 blocks (till block height = H + 2 5200) to obtain the lowest-tier coinlock reward. 
• 
Reward  Rate:  Assuming  that  users  lock  100  ETP  and  choose  the  fourth -tier  coinlock  reward  (requiring  H  +  108000  blocks),  their  address  will  reflect  a  balance  of  100  x  (1+0.67%) = 100.67 ETP after the 112,696th block  has been created. 
The initial design  provides five reward tiers, but the block height required for each tier does not  scale linearly. If we convert the block time to days (using the actual block time of 33 seconds for  calculations), we can estimate the time required for each coinlock tier : 
H+ block height

times will be determined by actual block times.) 
rates and unlocking  
This table presents the tier rewards in a more intuitive manner . Users will naturally compare and  contrast them with rates of return available elsewhere, since interest rates and rates  of return  form the backbone of the financial industry . Similar to how investors consider an investment’s  returns, users will also consider the opportunity cost of obtaining coinlock rewards, i.e. ETP’s  price fluctuations and  the development of its ecosystem. 
This is a bold design that attempts to create interest rates  native to the blockchain ecosystem and community, instead of depending on interest rates set by external  central banks. However, the  initial  implementation  of  this  design  is  not  ideal  because  the  interest  rate  is  not  dynamic or adjustable, let alone capable of reaching the true market rate through decentralization and  game  
theory mechanisms. 
both centralized 
As Metaverse progresses, we  will further promote the degree of activity of ETP in 
and decentralized trading markets. ETP trading pairs in these markets will  serve as key data  points to determine ETP interest rates; they will be used as input parameters to influence E TP’s

economic model either through  voting or by directly obtaining data from the decentralized market.  The  volume  of  ETP  transfer  activity,  the  number  of  accounts ,  special  transactions  (to  be  developed) and other blockchain parameters may also be incorporated into this  model. 
5E3IBOEIA 
ETP is the token representing the rights and interests  of Metaverse’s Democratic Autonomous  Organization (DAO). Because ETP is not a currency it should not be subject to inflation. However,  token loss may occur for a number of reasons such as  forgotten passwords, carelessness or  death. As such, the issue of there being insufficient ETP in circulation will steadily worsen.  In  Ethereum’s white paper, Vitalik Buterin predicated an annual loss rate of 1%. 
Considering that token loss may occur and the possibility that a large amount of ETP may be  pledged or hoarded, the ETP economic model we have designed requires the  introduction of  micro-inflation to fill the demand for ETP circulation . We have distributed a total of 50 million ETP  through ICOs and the Metaverse Foundation, and a further 30 million ETP will be distributed  through  the  mining  process.  We  will  continue  t o  release  small  amounts  of  ETP  in  an  orderly  fashion through coinlock rewards, with specific reward amount s determined by the total amount  of coins deposited and the locking period chosen. ETP inflation rates will be fed back into the  algorithm determining  coinlock reward rates, allowing it to be dynamically adjusted. 
This feedback mechanism enables the system to self -adjust and recover and will be upgraded  with subsequent versions of Metaverse to be more robust. Our end goal is to rea lize more intuitive  economic models and a more effective economic  environment on the Metaverse platform. 
9HMO,AO 
Bitcoin’s Wikipedia page wrongly credits the concept of "smart assets" to Nick Szabo’s 1997 study  – more accurately, Szabo defined a class of assets embedded with smart contracts to execute  certain contract terms. 
The Ethereum project overemphasizes the concept of smart contracts such that the existence of  digital assets is dependent on smart contracts . This design runs counter to  intuition. 
In Metaverse, we want to re-emphasize the importance of digital assets. Smart contracts should  be dependent on digital assets, not the other way around. Using the object -oriented programming  model as an analogy, digital assets would form a clas s, whereas contracts are methods contained  within the class. 
Unlike  Ethereum,  Metaverse’s  native  digital  token  ETP  will  use Bitcoin’s  UTXO  (Unspent  Transaction Output)  model in which all transactions are defined by a set of inputs and outputs,  and  contain the  private  key  signatures  of  all  current  and  previous  owners  of  the  ETP.  These  elements  come  together  to  form  a  new  UTXO.  Separately,  we  will  be  testing  the  use  of  the  Account model to handle smart assets . This can help reduce system complexity  while retaining the benefits of the UTXO model. 
The result of this design is that digital assets can be sent and received 
easily on Metaverse, just

like Bitcoin. Smart contracts will only be required when the demand for more complex transaction s 
arise.

(1) Why do we register Smart Assets? 
One of blockchain’s benefits is that it offers a timestamped, append -only public data store that does not allow past records to be altered or deleted (note that it is “not allowed” rather than  “not possible”, since in reality it is possible for previously recorded transactions to be altered  and deleted because a blockchain’s ability to resist attacks is imperfect and 
special permissions could interfere with the blockchain ). 
individuals with  
This property fulfills the design requirements  of registration functions – they are public, unique  and trustworthy. Hence, registration on the blockchain need not be limited to  just Smart Assets.  Any data that has value has a reason to seek ways to be stored on the blockchain. 
(2) How should the Smart Asset registration function be designed? 
When we mention “registration” , what we actually refer to is the act of describing something  with  data.  As  such,  the  first  step  to  registering  Smart  Assets  is  to  find  a  set  of  data  that  describes an “asset”, taking special note of two key design requirements: 
A. This descriptive set of data should be reusable , or its design would have failed and  be  
ineffective. 
B. Considering potential future applications ,  it  should  be  accompanied  by  a  set  of  query,  
addition, calculation and verification functions. 
Considering  that  “Assets”  usually  have  relatively  simple  generic  attributes  and  well - differentiated  special  attributes and  that  the  important  data  is  generated  during  the  asset  transfer process, smart asset registration can be described as filling out a form similar to the  
below.

========13========

 
After  satisfying the  basic  information  structure  requirements  outlined  above,  we  must next consider how this information will be used. Bitshares attempted to issue assets on the basis of  market  functions,  but  this  method  produced  numerous  limitations  including  complex  ove r- collateralization,  anchoring  and  price  feed mechanisms.  Because  the  underlying  financial  infrastructure was incomplete, the market was unable to make full use of these applications on a  large scale.  
Blockchain systems such as Bit Shares and Ethereum ha ve also begun exploring the feasibility of  the Proof of Assets (PoA) protocol. On BitShares, i f the authenticity of smart assets can be verified  by alternative means such as posting one’s private key signature on forums or by providing an  asset certificate tied to your account’s credit, it can be valued in the open market by those who  recognize  the  asset.  The  issue  with  this  method  is  that  it  is  inconvenient  to  provide  such  verifications on the BitShares, and furthermore users lack an incentive to issue the ir blockchain  assets within a less liquid market.  
In Ethereum, smart contracts seem to be able to handle all problems, including defining tokens.   Some tokens can actually be regarded as  smart assets because they store value and are editable.  Smart contracts can theoretically support any wild business model, giving rise to projects such as  Digix. It cleverly engaged third parties (gold exchanges, accounting firms,  custodians) to provide  a series of asset certifications forming a chain of evidence rec ognized by markets. This evidence  is recorded on the blockchain, rendering the asset’s registration tamper -proof. (Of course, this  scenario doesn’t consider artificial hard forks .) 
The  second  step  incorporates  registration  fees  into  the  design  of  Metavers e’s  economy.  Metaverse took the following items into consideration: 
A. The legitimacy and reasonableness of registration fees. Registration fees are undoubtedly  
legitimate, because they create a self-protection mechanism for the system. When smart  
assets can be registered with zero or low costs, the system becomes vulnerable to DDoS  
attacks. However, what would be an appropriate amount for a registration fee?  Presently,  
this has yet to be determined. No one can  predict what the value of an ETP token, which

weighted algorithm. 
B. This fee is not a traditional transaction fee because the transaction is not a transf er, but  
rather  a  new  transaction  type  with  specific  functions.  A  portion  of  all  transaction  fees  
generated by these new transaction types will be sent to a special system address to  
support Metaverse’s  developer  community,  with the remainder allocated to nodes that  
generate blocks. 
(3) What can be done after a Smart Asset is registered? 
The  registration  of  smart  assets  on  the  blockchain  does  not  occur  in  isolation;  other s must  recognize it through the PoA protocol before it gains the attributes of an asset, otherwise it is a  meaningless string of data. Once recognized, Smart Assets have two types of attributes: value  attributes and editable attributes (or attributes “worth editing”). Value attributes are reflected by  constant trading and changes in  the asset’s market value. Editable attributes will apply constraints

placed on asset circulation in the real world to smart assets registered on the blockchain through  various  technical  means  (including  smart  contracts  based  on  virtual  machines  and  business - based scripting languages). 
Metaverse will mainly focus on developing smart assets using the PoA model. Hence, its design  will  pay  special  attention  to  helping  users  easily  provide  PoA.  In  addition  to  those  above,  Metaverse also raised the followin g points:  
1) Using the datafeed provided by Value Intermediaries (Oracles) to prove an asset’s value.  
From this point of view, each third party in the Digix project is an Oracle instance. 2) A credit  transfer  model  based  on  blockchain  transactions.  By  constructing  a  pair  of  
symmetrical transaction s, Oracles can carry out asset authentication through the process  
illustrated below.

identities. In turn, these digital identities  are secured through mathematical concepts t o ensure  they cannot be forged. 
As a symbol of one’s online identity, Avatars can be used to represent oneself and hold smart  assets on the blockchain. 
Creating an Avatar involves far more than just giving your public key an alias, jus t as ID cards  and mobile numbers are not an alias for your name . Other pieces of data with application value  will be attached to each Avatar’s unique index and secured through cryptography to protect data  privacy. Unless the Avatar’s owner grants authorization (by providing the private key signature,  initiating a special transaction or via smart contracts), users will not  be able to access an Avatar’s  data regardless of whether it has been encrypted . Here, zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic  encryption play a vital role  in allowing Avatars to retrieve information such as credit scores and  validation results without revealing the contents of a message. Although the Bitcoin system allows  one to hold Bitcoin anonymously using public and private keypairs, most activities in the  real world  require us to provide some form of personal information: for example, you must provide your age  and gender to join a young female entrepreneur’s club. 
Avatars can be held by a real person, but can also be held by artificial intelligence (AI), machines in the Internet of Things (IoT), companies or organizations.  
A single Avatar may hold multiple types of smart assets, and a single smart asset may also be  owned  by  multiple  Avatars.  Thus,  there  is  a  many -to-many relationship between Avatars and  smart assets. Many-to-many relationships appear more complex, but more a ccurately reflect what  ownership  looks  like  in  the  real world.  These  relationships  are  authenticated  and  secured  on  Metaverse through cryptography. 
There  are  plenty of  specific  (financial)  use  cases  built  on  smart  assets ,  including  trading,  borrowing, leasing and mortgaging to name a few.

The  digital  identity  information  held  applications is  a  subset  of  the  digital  identity  information  available on the client end, which implies that (1) the client retains absolute ownership and usage  rights  over  its  identity  information.  Although  the  application  has  a  temporary  right  to  use  this  information, its ultimately belongs to the client. (2) A portion of the data dictionary must be share d  between the client and application, or  some intersecting data fields cannot be matched and the  intersection will be left empty. 
As for (1), the basic idea is to protect the client’s identity information-related interests from being  violated by the application. Users are responsible for declaring ownership of their digital identities  through  active  management  methods  such  as  “timely  identity  creation”,  “status  updates” and  “seeking certification”.  Alternatively, users can obtain services from the ap plication by selectively  authorizing some information while still retaining absolute ownership over  it. This issue will be  discussed later in this white paper. 
As for (2), the basic idea is to allow the client limited freedom to define field names. This i ssue  will also be discussed later.

As we all know, asymmetric encryption uses public keys for encryption and the corresponding  private key for decryption, allowing information to be  privately transmitted. Additionally, digital  signatures made with private keys allow users to prove their identity through the corresponding  public key. Keypairs achieve the following goals:  
1) Person A can encrypt all his digital identity information from the beginning 
2) Person A can disclose a portion of his digital identity information without revealing his/her  
private key. 
3) Person  B  can  verify  that  the  information  provided  by  person  A  is  consistent  with  the  
plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext registered on the blockchain.  
1ECPMA 
However, this construct is unable to solve problems outside the scope of the three goals outlined  above. For example, person B could still leak the personal information he has obtained from A,  compromising A’s privacy. 
Furthermore,  since  transactions  on  the  blockchain  are  accompanied  by  digital  signatures,  transactions that share identity-related information and transactions that create the digital identity  generally originate from the same account. This remove s the need to include A’s digital signature  within ciphertext c1. However, if these two transactions are initiated by different accounts, A must  provide the digital signature of the account that created the digital identity to prove that A does in  fact own that digital identity.

providers. Once a digital identity is stored on their servers, it becomes almost impossible to retain  sovereignty over one’s personal information.  
Metaverse believes that digital identities should be classified as a form of intellectual property ,  and should form a special asset class . The exposure of identity information in plaintext usually  implies  a  violation  of  intellectual  property  rights,  but  this  action  of  “sharing”  demonstrates  the  changing nature of ‘value’. It remains to be seen whether users will derive benefit or harm from  this change.  
Metaverse provides a platfo rm where anyone can register a personalized "resume": in exchange  for  a  small  information  storage  fee,  users  will  possess  a  customized,  tamper -proof  resume.  Timestamps  and  public/private  key  encryption will  jointly  protect  one’s  information  ownership  rights.  Although  names  and  mobile  phone  numbers  can  be  misappropriated  by  malicious  individuals, they are unable to provide stronger evidence chains  such as verification codes and  passport numbers. Thus, users will simultaneously own the earliest, most complete and latest  version  of  their  digital  identity  which  will  belong  exclusively  to  them.  The  authentication  mechanism for digital identities on Metaverse is similar to that of smart assets and will be provided  by Oracles. This will be elaborated on later in the Oracle section. 
Creating a digital identity on Metaverse involves the following steps: 
(1) Providing  personal  information  that  can  be  strongly  verified  such  as  email  
addresses and mobile phone numbers 
(2) Customizing other personal information by defining  field names and field values. 
For example, "City", then "Shanghai". 
(3) If you do not wish to be registered on the blockchain immediately, your information  
can be stored locally and modified at any time.  
(4) For the information to become an immutable record, user s must pay a small fee in  
ETP to create a digital identity  and issue the transaction on the blockchain. 
Using this digital identity on Metaverse will require the following steps: 
(1) Application service providers will submit  requests for data; this data can be shared  
as per Figure 4. 
(2) Request for an Oracle to verify the digital identity you have just registered. These  
Oracles  may  include  banks,  the  public  security  system,  or  friends  who  have  
already been verified. 
(3) A timeline of your personal resume will be gen erated. The effects of this simple  
application are more apparent after a number of years  - you will find a pristine  
record  of  your  life  journey  that  has  n ot been modified by unscrupulous service  
providers.

group arbitration, with the third being a guarantor . 
Blockchain technology claims to do away with trusted intermediaries (“cutting out the middleman”).  At the moment, this seems like a fantasy. We believe that intermediaries will continue play an  important role for some time to come.  They  act as wormholes between the virt ual and physical  worlds – without intermediaries, communication between these worlds will be hindered. Presently  we lack a way to quantify the value perception and logic of these two worlds in code, let alone in  practical application.  
Unlike  the  slogan  of  “cutting  out  the middleman”,  Metaverse  will  reserve  a position  on  the  blockchain  for value intermediaries, otherwise known as Oracles . Custodian Oracles can take  custody  of  physical  assets  and  issue  them  as  smart  assets  on  the  blockchain,  whi le  identity  verification  Oracles  can  provide  proof  for  personal  information  related  to  Avatars.  Regulatory  Oracles  (such  as  government  departments  regulating  special  transactions)  can  also  provide  services such as proof of transaction authenticity and proo f of compliance. Many other Oracles  can provide similar services on Metaverse. 
On  the  macro  level,  Oracles  also  enrich  the  types  of  transactions  available,  adding  value  to  blockchains.  
After  Metaverse  distributes  30,000,000  ETP  through PoW  mining,  DPoS  mining  rewards  will  mainly be sourced from transaction fees. M etaverse has designed a number of  native functions for the value intermediary ecosystem based on information registration, certification and other  transaction types. In turn, each transaction type supports various applications related to digital  identity and smart assets. We foresee that the the total amount of transaction fees, as well as the  added value created by them, will increase . 
The issue of how transaction fees (usage  fees) can be reduced within payment networks such as  Bitcoin is a constant topic of discussion among us. At the same time, increasing block size and  creation  rate  would  help  meet business  needs  and  inject  a  constant  stream  of  value  into  the  network,  incentivizing  miners  and  nodes  to  support  the  distributed  ledger.  Re-examining  this  problem, when  transaction  fees are  charged  not  just  for  transactions  but  also  for  blockchain  services (such as value intermediary services or smart contract activation ), then the value of a  blockchain will no longer be solely reliant  on its block capacity and creation rate. Blockchains  could create value by enhancing service quality and increasing the types of services available,  ushering in new opportunities. 
The incentive model for miners will also reach a new equilibrium since they will obtain a larger cut  from service fees with higher profit rates.  In the past, these services were conducted offline and  neither  used the  benefits  of  blockchain  technology  (except  to  recor d  the  transaction) nor  contributed  back  to the  blockchain system (except  for  the  transaction  fee).  Recording  these  ‘transactions’ feels somewhat pointless. All services will be priced  in tokens at the market rate    based on their scarcity, importance a nd other characteristics.

Blockchain bloat 
Bitcoin’s  blockch ain  grows  by  about  1  MB  every  ten  minutes  (1GB  weekly),  noticeably  increasing the cost of running a full node. Bitcoin has seen a decline in the total number of full  nodes globally, from about 10,000 in late 2013 to roughly 5,500 in July 2016.  Ethereum’s  blockchain  grows  at  a  rate  of  2GB  per  month  and  is  picking  up  speed.  The  Metaverse  blockchain will eventually face  bloat, a problem that might be exacerbated by Metaverse’s use  of the UTXO model. This issue is well documented in Ethereum’s White Paper – in the early  stages it will be addressed by miners, since they must operate full nodes to mine. 
• 
The problem with mining centralization 
Mining is a double -edged sword. On one hand , it guarantees that the system is protected by  computing  power,  but  on  the  other  hand  it  produce s fresh  problems  such  as  mining  centralization and the potential threat of a 51% attack.  
Mining centralization  produces extremely undesirable results in the Bitcoin industry and  led to  the gradual erosion of Ethereum’s first mover advantage. 
Although we cannot guarantee that this problem will be avoided, Metaverse hopes to slow  down its progress sufficiently by optimizing the mining algorithm  until the system migrates to  the HBTH-DPoS consensus algorithm. 
• 
Potential failures brought about by business success 
If Metaverse achieves business success, it will face a new wave of risks. When  the total value  of digital assets on Metaverse reaches a certain level, it becomes profitable to attack the  Metaverse system and short its digital assets on  an exchange. Thus, the total value of the  digital assets on Metaverse is a function of the cost of  maintaining / attacking the system (during the PoW stage, this refers to the cost of mining). Ideally, the total value of the digital  assets should not exceed five times  of the cost of mining.

The  core  of  a  blockchain  is  the  ledger ,  and  the  core  function  of  a  ledger  is  to  keep  records. Metaverse will center the design of its digital asset and digital identity ledgers around  the concept  of ledgers, and will not consider precipitating  application layer content on top of basic functions.  We will strive to keep all functions as simple as possible and expand the  underlying infrastructure  through Metaverse Improvement Proposals (MIP s). We call this the minimalist design principle.

Metaverse development is divided into the following two phases: 
In  the  first  phase,  Metaverse  will  be  based  on  the  PoW  consensus  algorithm.  It  will  primarily  provide functions such as digital identities, digital asset registration and transfer, simpl e built-in  scripts and datafeeds  and  credit  ratings.  Metaverse  can  be  used  to  support  all  consortium  blockchains, forming an open platform ecosystem.  
In  the  second  phase,  Metaverse  will  transit  to  a DPoS-based enhanced  consensus algorithm  (HBTH-DPoS). Building upon the ecosystem  developed during  the first phase, we will extend  smart contract functions and provide complete Oracle services. 
The following section will mainly discuss  Metaverse’s technology selection and architecture. 	 
:AICS59AEI 
For the first phase, there were three  technical solutions to choose from: the Bitcoin, Ethereum  and Bitshares systems. Amongst these three, Ethereum’s code system updates iterations more quickly and comes with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). Considering the limited resources  and  time  available  to  Metaverse during  its  initial  development  (low -level  reconstruction),  Ethereum’s system may not be suitable. 
The entry point for Metaverse is digital identity and digital assets . Metaverse once  considered an  extremely idealized Bitshares syste m. However, due to  its “anchoring mechanism” and non-UTXO  model, we  can only  subtract  from  their  code.  Due  to  code  reusability  principles,  the  risk  and  difficulty of subtracting code far outweighs that of adding code. Thus, Metaverse finally  selected Bitcoin’s technology system. 
Within Bitcoin’s technology system, M etaverse’s main code uses Libbitcoin as the framework to  design its own Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) account system. Ethereum’s Ethash algorithm was  integrated to design a variety of asset transaction types. 
Advantages of choosing Libbitcoin: 
1. Metaverse  is  not  just  an altcoin.  The  integration  of  digital  assets  and  digital  identity  
requires code to be highly modular.  Studying versions 0.8 and 0.12 of the Bitcoin code,  
we believe the  degree of coupling in Bitcoin Core’s code is relatively high, which is not  
conducive to the development and maintenance of Metaverse. 
2. In terms of code structure, some historical problems  with Bitcoin Core (e.g. mixing C++  
templates and macros) hinder debugging. Unclear class inheritance structures also hinder  
reconstruction. 
3. Bitcoin Core’s code does not support Unicode. 
 
 
 

========22========

 
After comparing Libbitcoin and Bitcoin Core’s code,  we found Libbitcoin to be more advantageous ,  especially in the areas of readability and module coupling. 
Disadvantages of  choosing Libbitcoin:  
1. Missing important modules such as miner, account and json -rpc; 
2. It  contains  more  bugs  related  to  block  synchronization  and  establishing  network  
connections; 
3. As a result of using the boost -asio library, Libbitcoin designed a large number of handlers  
to achieve the asynchronous effect, complicating the tracking and debugging of underlying  
modules; 
4. Huge amounts of code (the module design and forced code style req uired extra coding). 
-E,MEOAPMA 
1ECPMA,MDEOAOPMA/ECMHB 
During the first phase, we  have designed the following five layers for the Metaverse client.  
 
.HHI 4SAM 
This  layer  is  a  basic  storage  layer containing  a  number  of  definitions  for  basic  classes,  configuration inheritance s, math libraries, flow processing libraries and other general functions.  This common layer is composed of small functions, basic classes and C + + templates and also  contains  important  libraries such  as  secp265k1 and  zmq and  implements  a  large  number  of  primitive types, such as: 
bc::wallet::script – transaction scripts  
bc::wallet::payment_address – transaction address  
 
 
 

========23========

 
.HIAIO 4SAM 
The component layer contains the  core  components  of  a  blockchain:  network  communication (network),  block  persistence (database) and  consensus  processes (consensus).  The  entire  blockchain is dependent on the network module for survival.  
• 
Network 
The  P2P network,  PoW  mechanism  and  verificat ion  have  been  included  in  this  layer.  The  bottommost layer is used to support P2P network modules for all network messages (it does not  support  LAN  penetration).  The  consensus  module  contains  functions  related  to  mining,  block  verification and network diff iculty adjustment. 
Now we consider full nodes. In terms of inheritance levels, we have server_node structure of the  bottom, which contains the following  members: 
• • • • 
Mongoose server is a http server ; 
Miner refers to the consensus module; 
The public query provides an open, encrypted query interface (binary system); server_node is derived from p2p node. 
p2p node is described below. 
 
 
 

========24========

 
• 
• 
p2p node contains the main blockchain services . blockchain is mainly composed of  transaction-pool and database.  
p2p node is also derived from p2p network. 
Again, p2p network is described below. 
In other words, the entire inheritance level a lso reflects how the network module forms the basis  of the entire blockchain . 
The contents of the consensus verification portion  are integrated into server_node through the  miner (consensus) module, which is also a  low-level module.  
• 
Database 
Storage (database) is not a traditional database, but rather a small local embedded database. At  present, SQLite and LevelDB are the available mainstream options. 
Early on in the technical selection process, we considered using S QLite in place of Libbitcoin’s  native key / value hash -memory-map file storage method. 
 
 
 

========25========

 
Taking SQLite’s performance and the technical complexity of replacing Libbitcoin’s existing code  into  account,  we  decided  to  retain  Libbitcoin’s  original  hash -memory-map  approach.  Th e  advantages of this  method are superior speed and performance and  easy access to memory- pool. However, it lacks exten sibility, and has a certain learning cost. 
• 
Consensus  
The Consensus module mainly provides the ETHASH consensus algorithm, stand -alone CPU  mining module and transaction verification module. 
5A4SAM  
 
According to the  architecture diagram for v0.3, we can see that  Model layer contains two core  elements: Account and Ledger. 
• 
Account 
Based  on  HD  key-pairs,  we  designed  a  two -layer HD account. The  Account  model  will  be  extended to form digital identities in  the application layer.  
• 
Ledger 
Based  on  the  UTXO  model,  we  designed  an  extended  transaction  that  is  different  from  ETP  transactions. These extended transactions categorized under: digital identity ledger, digital asset  ledger and data-feed off-chain data reference ledger. 
The following diagram illustrates Metaverse’s implementation of different transaction types . 
1ECPMA:MIOEIEHAHAIOOEI

9AMEA4SAM  
 
The service layer contains two types of interfaces: a Query Service and a Subscription Service.  Query services can be implemented  through three interface formats – RestFul API, Websocket  or Json-RPC; subscription services can be implemented through Websock et.  
All services are provided to user s with HTTP Server as the interface gateway and are used by  calling commands. 
The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the service layer and other layers:  
• HTTP Server – mongoose 
Mongoose is an  HTTP Server with small concurrent volume, based on select / epoll (optional).  Considering Metaverse is a user -facing program, the main consideration is for ease of use  rather than concurrent volume.  
• 
Users’ command set  
The command set can be divided into two categories: 
• Online  commands  refer  to  those  that  will  interact  with  the  blockchain,  such  as  the  
getbalance command. 
• Offline  commands  refer  to  commands  that  purely  perform  c omputations,  such  as  the  
getaccount / fetch-tx command; 
/ES 4SAM 
 
The  display  layer  is  a  human -machine  interface  (HMI).  Currently,  we  have  established  an  AngularJs library for the desktop version that interacts with the core of the Metaverse Wallet. For  mobile devices, mixed development method s will be used to  build a light payment client.

A property of the internet of information is that businesses and technology can be decoupled via  multilayered architectures that separate business  layers from technical layers. 
The properties of the internet of value are: it has an exclusive nature, and comes with  a financial  system. When separated from this financial system, it become s a classic distributed system and  cannot be called an internet of value. 
On the internet of information, the typical product separating business and technology is cloud  computing. Today,  cloud  computing  has  gradually  expanded  beyond  these  limits and  is  attempting to penetrate multiple verticals and industries to provide better technical solutions. A  common example would be financial services solutions hosted on the cloud . 
However, these solutions use multi-instance architecture. For example, Company A and Company  B both purchase the same product F.  However, the companies will eventually run completely  different instances of product F. There is normally no direct relation between  these companies,  apart  from  arbitrary  connections  through  third  party  financial  institutions  such  as  banks  or  securities companies. 
In contrast, on the internet of value,  A and B should run different subnets on the same instance  of application F. There is a direct rather than indirect link between A and B; in other words, some  services  provided  by  third  party  financial  institutions such  as  payment  functions will  become  unnecessary (since blockchains are intrinsically equipped with a payment system ). 
Metaverse hopes to establish  an internet of value through the provision of these basic services.

Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) refers to using data generated by blockchains to provide a series  of blockchain-based operational services such as searches, queries and data submission. 
In  the  blockchain  sector,  block  explorers,  digital  currency  trading  platforms  and applications  derived from public chains such as  document storage (Factom)  and digital identity (uPort) all  currently fall under the umbrella of blockchain services. 
These applications share one feature:  they are based on existing public blockchains, and exhibit  or strengthen the existing functions of public blockchains rather than use blockchain technology  to create a private service.

The  blockchain  consensus  process  refers  to  the  process  of  objectively  recording  the  entire  network’s  transaction  data  and  making  it immutable.  This  consensus  process  is  implemented  through consensus algorithms. 
Currently,  several  mainstream  consensus  algo rithms  exist.  These  include  the  PoW  (Proof  of  Work), PoS (Proof of Stake) and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) mechanisms used by Bitcoin,  Ethereum and Bitshares respectively.  
These algorithms are generally  termed  “economic”  algorithms because they allow the  cost  of  cheating the system to be calculated. They ensure that cheating is unprofitable by making the  cost of cheating much greater than its reward.  Through this, they create an algorithm that makes  use of economic games between nodes to tend towards  a stable equilibrium. 
Correspondingly, we also have  distributed consistency algorithms in the field of computing such  as Paxos and Raft. These can be called classic distributed co nsistency algorithms.  
The biggest difference between  distributed consistency algorithms is their reliability when faced  with the Byzantine Generals Problem , otherwise known as Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT is  Byzantine fault tolerant).  Both Paxos and Raft are theoretically susceptible to getting stuck in an  dead loop with no possibility of passing through via th e voting system (although this probability is  extremely small). However, both algorithms meet the safety requirement,  just that the liveness  requirement is relaxed. PBFT is similar in this regard. 
The similarities  and differences between traditional distributed  consistency algorithms and the  blockchain consensus proces s are outlined below.  
Similarities

Append only  
Emphasis on sequencing  
The principle of the minority  obeying the majority 
The problem of separate  coverage: blocks in longer chains override the shorter ones,  and multi-nodes override the logs generated by smaller numbers of nodes  
Differences  
• 
• 
Traditional distributed cons istency algorithms do not take Byzantine  fault tolerance into  account (except for Byzanetine Paxos). They assume that all nodes only meet non -man- made problems such as crashes or network malfunctions, and do not consider the problem  of malicious nodes tampering with data. 
Traditional distributed con sistency algorithms cater to logs (databases), are more general  situation,  whereas  the  blockchain  consensus  model  caters  to  transactions.  S trictly  speaking, traditional distributed cons istency algorithms hence belong to underneath the  layer containing the blockchain consensus mode l. 
 
 
 

========30========

 
Metaverse is a public blockchain.  Several prominent consensus algorithm designs used in public  blockchains include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake  (DPoS)  pioneered  by  Bitcoin,  Peercoin  and  BitShares  respectively,  as  well  as  several  other  Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols.   
Most cryptocurrencies choose to ignore Byza ntine fault tolerant algorithms as they fail to resolve  token distribution issues. Although Metaverse’s ETP is not a currency, it will be distributed to  nodes as repayment for their contribution to network safety. 
The total amounts of full nodes is inadequate in the early phases of any blockchain project, making  it more difficult to guarantee the entire  network’s system  security. Through the introduction of  PoW mining,  Metaverse  will  distribute  ETP  to  mining  nodes  as  block  rewards,  allowing  the  network to attract a large number of full nodes that can secure the  system in its early stages.  
As the project mature s in the future, the ETP distribution used to provide mining rewards will draw  to  a  close and  Metaverse  will  switch  over to  an  improved  DPoS  consensus  algorithm.  This  algorithm will consider “Token Height Destroyed” in its design.  
First Phase: PoW Mining  
In the first few years of  the Metaverse system’s operations, GPU mining and a decentralised  timestamp  server  system will  be  employed  to  secure the  system.  We  are  still  looking  into  Metaverse’s mining algorithm, but will avoid  Bitcoin’s SHA256 and Litecoin’s scrypt algorithms to  avoid 51% attacks from Bitcoin and Litecoin mining pools . 
Second Phase: HBTH-DPoS  
Although PoW mining can help safeguard Metaverse’s system security in its initial years, it has  flaws such as energy waste and  the tendency for mining centraliztion. 
The DPoS mechanism pioneered by Bitshares is more robust and decentralized than PoW and  PoS. More importantly, each participant in its system is a qualified voter. 
However,  there  are  2  design  flaws  within  the  DPoS  consensus  mechanism.  Firstly,  financial  interference: by acquiring  a large number of tokens in a short time , attackers can interfere by  voting for or opposing important pro posals to manipulate the token price for short-term profit. In  the current Bitshares system, it is estimated that only  USD $3 million of tokens is required to  manipulate voting results.  
Secondly, voter apathy:  voters (users) are often uninterested in the state of a system. Once they  have chosen a delegate, most voters are unlikely to make a switch even when the delegate turns  out to be malicious. In the past three months, only 1% of voters changed their delegate. 
Metaverse improved the DPoS consensus  protocol by adding the concepts of Token -Height and  HeartBeat. The basic model is as follows:  
- 
Token-Height (TH) originates from the concept of Bitcoin Days Destroyed ; 
- 
Bitcoin Days Destroyed  = number of Bitcoins in  a transaction * number of days since the  
 
 
 

========31========

 
Bitcoins were last spent; 
- 
TH = number of ETP in a transaction * number of blocks since the ETP was last spent *  Metaverse constant 
By using TH to weight votes in DPoS, Metaverse aims to avoid financial interference  issues. If  attackers were to temporarily acquire large amounts of ETP to influence voting, their TH value  would be very small and thus they would hold little influence over the voting process. To achieve  their goal, attackers must either acquire more ETP f rom the market or hold the ETP for a sufficient  amount of time to gather TH. Both methods significantly increase the cost of an attack. 
In the DPoS phase, Metaverse will distribute ETP to  ETP holders based on their prevailing  stake, similar to other systems utilizing the PoS consensus  protocol. However, the difference is that ETP  holders will not receive ETP passively. Rather, they must send a “HeartBeat” to the system to  indicate  that  they  are  still  active.  At  the  same  time,  this  Hea rtBeat  is  equivalent  to  a  digital  signature from the owner's private key. Lastly,  ETP holders must choose to either replace or  maintain their delegate when sending  the HeartBeat.  
There are two advantages to designing the Heart Beat: firstly, it motivates  users to check their  delegates, alleviating though not fundamentally  resolving the voter apathy problem. Secondly, the  system will not allocate new ETP to inactive  holders, exerting a dilution effect on their holdings.  
In the DPoS phase, we will also consider using  an improved Power-DPOS algorithm. 
1ECPMA7RAM/79 
The model’s specifications are as follows: 
1) Separate  ETP’s  voting  and  transaction  attributes,  and  define  built -in  tokens  for  voting  
known as power. Define coinage as the basis of calculation for valid votes, which can  
prevent attacks carried out by obtaining large numbers of ETP from the trading market. 
2) The concept of coinage is defined as the accumulation of stake over tim e. This forms  
 
 
 

========32========

 
unforgeable “evidence”, similar to PoW. Considers that staking is the price and sacrifice  paid by holders, just as the verification of mathematical functions with CPUs or GPUs  requires  miners  to  incur  the  cost  of  electricity  and  computing  pow er.  The  formula  for  calculating coinage is as follows: 
- - - 
- 
- - 
Locked(ETP) is the number of ETP locked in a special address prior to voting; 
f(h) is a time density function related to height.; 
h1 refers to block height at the beginning of the locking period, h2 refers to block height at  which the ETP is unlocked; 
H is the maximum height at which ETP locking can generate coinage. When this limit is  exceeded excess height will not generate new coinage ; 
max refers to the number of blocks that can generate coinage ; 
a is an arbitrary conversion parameter. 
Assume h1 = 12000, current h = 14500, max h = 2000, the conversion parameter a = 5000 and  locked(ETP) = 5000. If the ETP is unlocked at this point, then h2 = h = 14500. But if H = h 
1 
+ max  = 14000 < h2, then coinage generated by the locked ETP would be: 
The graph is as follows: 
 
 
 

========33========

 
In this case, if the block time is about 15 seconds, then it takes about 8.33 hours to generate 2000  blocks. Attackers only need to lock their ETP for a short time to obtain the maximum voting weight,  which poses a large risk. Max can be adjusted to change this time. 
3) Coinage and power are linearly correlated. The ratio is defined as ratio(Coinage ToPower).   ETP generates power according to the following process:   
Local client: normal address (ETP for power)  → Local client: voting address (ETP for power)  → Locking is completed through  the transaction between addresses; the ETP is locked  once the  transaction is completed→ when the ETP is unlocked, calculate the coinage → unlock; unlocking  is the reverse of the locking transaction, but  unlocking does not occur instantly. The conditional  function for unlocking is: 
The first 100 blocks unlock 0.01%  of the locked ETP. This number increases by 10% every 100  blocks, i.e. the next hundred blocks unlock 0.01% * (1 + 10%)  of the locked ETP, until all blocks  are unlocked. Density and cumulative functions for the  amount of ETP unlocked every 100 blocks  are shown below: 
 
 
 

========34========

 
 
 
1ECPMA)4ABOVEOSBPIOE8ECDOVHPEBPIEI 
From the graphs,  one can see that unlocking speed is relatively slow at first, but will increase.  Under this assumption, it takes about 2400 blocks to complete  the unlocking process. If block  time is 15 seconds, it takes about 10 hours for unlocking to complete. Furthermore, the amount of ETP unlocked in the first 5 hours accounts for only about 20% of the total. If the total time needs  to be adjusted, the height interval to increase the amount of ETP unlocked  can be modified. For  example, if the interval is increased to 200 blocks, the time required doubles. 
To change the unlocking speed while preserving the shape of the curve, the rate at which the  number of blocks unlocked increase (increase ratio) should be adjusted. For example, if the ratio  is adjusted to 5%, the unlocking speed will decrease. 
Other  unlocking  models  are  also  available.  The  one  used  here  is  the  simplest,  a progression.

:MIEI:SA 
Besides the coinbase transaction, there is only one oth er type of transaction in bitcoin, which is  the transfer of coins between sender and receiver. 
With smart contracts, Ethereum greatly expanded the types of transactions that can take place  on the blockchain to include transactions such as asset issuance. However, users must be familiar  with  Solidity  (the  language used  to  code  smart  contracts  on  Ethereum)  to  execute  such  transactions. Although Ethereum’s team invested large amounts of effort to simplify the coding,  such as allowing functions to be written with just a few lines of code, the need to write code to use smart contracts will alienate many businesses and users.  
There are many transaction types on Metaverse. They were designed with efficiency and ease of  use in mind, and will resemble neither Ethereum’s one -contract-fits-all model, nor BitShares which  defined a large number of transaction types.  After ETP trading, smart asset issuance and digital  identity  registration  are  the  highest-priority  transaction  types.  Ethereum -style  smart  contract  transactions will then be added to the Metaverse system.

Metaverse  will use a hybrid combining Bitcoin’s UTXO model and the  balance-based Account  model. 
- The UTXO model will be used for ETP 
- The Account model will be used for user -defined digital assets 
For more information about the UTXO model , interested readers can consult the Bitcoin developer  documentation.  
	 
/ECEO3IOEOSBAA 
Metaverse  will  consult  and  integrate  the  zk-SNARK  (Zero-Knowledge  Succint  Non -Interactive  Argument of Knowledge) scheme proposed by Zcash to protect  users’ digital identity and privacy. 
Data-feed is another important function in Metaverse.  Unlike Ethereum, Metaverse’s data -feed  will largely be handled by Oracles. Their credibility will be based on two factors: 1) valid credentials  provided by the Orac le, and 2) their records on Metaverse. 
The market will provide feedback on their credibility in several ways. Firstly, data -feed users will  “vote” on their credibility  through their transaction records.  If users vote correctly, they will be  rewarded  (similar  to  rebates  for  leaving  reviews).  Suggestions  for  rules  to  determine  voting  outcomes and rewards will be disclosed in later versions. Secondly, inappropriate votes will be  decided through the voter’s motivation and their influence on the outcome. T hese actions will be  penalized – they will be recorded on Metaverse regardless of the voting outcome, and Avatars  and  Oracles  can  choose  to  consider  or  ignore  these  records  when  transacting  with  digital  identities.  
The  reason  for  this  is  because business logic  should  not  be  hardcoded  into  Metaverse.  All  blockchains are bound by their basic function: consensus. For data -feeds, malicious behavior will  only impact their effectivess, rather than consensus in Metaverse.  Actions that use data -feeds  “for evil” must pay the price to Metaverse’s consensus, but these defenses must be implemented  in the Oracle or business application layers. Even so, the team designing Metaverse still hopes  that there can be a healthy data-feed model. As such, we will give suggestions for rules.  
.M 
Metaverse  will  be  compatible  with  Windows/Linux/MacOS  platforms  in  its  initial  stages.  As  Metaverse  develops,  we  will  consider  transplanting  Metaverse  to  ARM  or  other  embedded  platforms to facilitate asset digitization in the Internet of Things and Energy Internet.

Plutus White Paper 
https://plutus.it 
June 30, 2016 
v1.1 
Introduction 
The Plutus Mobile Application enables a user to make contactless Bitcoin payments at any merchant with a Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled checkout terminal. This is the most practical way to pay with Bitcoin, because the payment process consists only of holding a mobile device above the merchants NFC reader. As a result, Bitcoin payments are eﬀectively accepted by proxy at over 32 million brick and 
mortar merchants around the world. 
The primary purpose of Plutus is to provide incentive for, and enable, the practical day-to-day usage of Bitcoin; ultimately accelerating mass-consumer adoption. 
The competitive advantage of Plutus, within the mobile payments industry, is the eﬀective utiliza- tion of the rapidly expanding Ethereum network. Through a transparent and decentralized network protocol, underwritten by distributed ledger technology (the blockchain), Ethereum allows Plutus to de- ploy smart contracts to enable secure, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of ﬁat currency and Bitcoin, with the added beneﬁt of automatic escrow. Using these methods, the Plutus Decentralized Exchange Network (PlutusDEX) of traders convert Bitcoin deposits into a prepaid debit balance that is valid at any contact- 
less point-of-sale (POS) terminal. 
The philosophy of the application itself is open, inclusive and committed to the network health and widespread usage of Bitcoin. As such, a public trading API will be available, and 3rd party development 
is encouraged. 
1 The Ecosystem 
Bitcoin merchant adoption has thus far proved to be a challenging endeavor. Merchants are hesitant to accept it, and users are unable to spend it. Because there is no widespread Bitcoin point-of-sale (POS) infrastructure currently in place, merchants often re- consider accepting Bitcoin due to its perceived com- plexity, which may increase labor costs in the short run, because of the extra employee training required. 
adoption, consumers immediately gain both local and international opportunities for spending the digital currency at physical locations. The Plutus ecosys- tem can be seen in Figure 1. The chicken-and-the- egg problem is solved through both increased user and merchant adoption, because of Plutus vastly im- proved ease-of-use, lowered costs, and greater eﬃ- ciency for merchants, in both the long run and the short run. 
In many cases, they stop accepting Bitcoin or become 
2 Overview & Process 
frustrated with early technical diﬃculties. These dif- ﬁculties often lead to narrowing merchant adoption of Bitcoin and the blockchain infrastructure in gen- eral. This creates a kind of chicken-and-the-egg prob- lem, which contributes to forcing merchant-side Bit- coin payment processors to signiﬁcantly limit their expansion and adoption eﬀorts. 
This is the crux of the problem which makes Plutus an optimal use case and ideal app for miners, en- trepreneurs, freelancers and anyone else who earns Bitcoin. By avoiding the need to wait for merchant 
Plutus relies heavily on distributed computing and in- corporates connections to the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, as well as the traditional debit card infras- tructure. As such, it is a hybrid system with both centralized and decentralized network components. 
The structure of the Plutus Internal Infrastructure (Figure 2) relies on several interconnected servers and modules. The mobile app itself connects via Se- cure Sockets Layer (SSL) end-to-end encryption to 
1

========2========

the Plutus app server, which in turn communicates with the other network servers. The Bitcoin track- ing server reads transaction data contained in the header of each block broadcast onto the Bitcoin net- work to conﬁrm when payments have been completed. Plutons are divisible and tradable assets created on the Ethereum network. This ensures that all Plutons, whether they are traded or transacted between users, are safely conﬁrmed, and permanently stored on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The PlutusDEX, or DEX, is a dApp (decentralized application) on the Ethereum blockchain which han- dles Bitcoin and Pluton trading and matches orders. Traders can register at http://dex.plutus.it to in- teract with other users on the decentralized exchange to purchase Bitcoins and Plutons using ﬁat moneys, i.e. GBP, USD, or EUR. The dApp parses the data from each traders price and quantity submitted to the exchange. The Bitcoin tracking server monitors the address of each user of the mobile app. As a user deposits Bitcoins onto their mobile app, the amount is instantly matched with the best valued oﬀer from a DEX trader, and the user is sent their rebate reward in the form of Plutons. The DEX trader sends the correct amount of ﬁat currency to the Plutus Escrow, where it is then relayed to the merchants bank and completes the transaction cycle, as shown in Figure 3. 
1. An app user enters an amount of Bitcoin to de- 
posit. The DEX dApp instantly matches the re- 
quest with the best price provided by veriﬁed 
traders on the PlutusDEX platform, along with 
the corresponding Bitcoin and/or Pluton payout 
address. 
1. A Bitcoin or Pluton deposit request is sent to 
the DEX dApp running on the Ethereum 
blockchain via the Plutus internal server. 2. Oﬀers and bids are matched using the DEX 
dApp, resulting in a sale of digital tokens 
for ﬁat currency at the current market rate. 
The DEX dApp sends an event message to 
the app user containing the public address 
of the trader who exchanges the users Bit- 
coin for ﬁat. 
2. The Plutus internal server (centralized) con- 
ﬁrms deposits and transaction details on 
the Bitcoin blockchain, as well as on 
Ethereums blockchain. It then sends the 
event message to the DEX dApp (decentral- 
ized) running on the Ethereum blockchain. 
3. Traders must verify their account and identity on 
the PlutusDEX platform to enable any transfer 
of funds to the Plutus escrow account. A trader 
can then enter trade information (create a bid) 
on the DEX dApp. Traders announce their pay- 
out wallet address in advance, in order to re- 
ceive Bitcoin or Pluton deposits directly from 
app users. 
1. Traders can use any valid Bitcoin address, 
and hold their own private keys. Oﬄine 
wallets and cold storage are recommended. 2. Deposits of ﬁat-currency to Plutus escrow is 
completed via the DEX dApp. Details of 
all trades and deposits are stored on the 
Ethereum blockchain. 
4. Next, the Plutus internal server receives veriﬁca- 
tions from the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains 
of the completed transaction stored within the 
DEX dApp. Funds are immediately deducted 
from the DEX users escrow account and then re- 
leased to the prepaid virtual debit card on the 
mobile app in the selected local currency. 
1. The Virtual Debit Card (VDC) gateway en- 
ables contactless balance creation in GBP, 
USD, and EUR. 
5. The merchant then receives payment authoriza- 
tion via the VDC gateway. Funds in their pre- 
ferred currency are forwarded to the merchants 
bank through the established worldwide debit 
card banking network. 
1. Finally, a transaction conﬁrmation is sent to 
the app which triggers an update to the 
contactless balance for the mobile app user. 
2. The DEX dApp receives blockchain transaction

veriﬁcation via the Plutus tracking server, which interacts with both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Upon conﬁrmation, the DEX dApp marks the transaction as complete. 
1. A notiﬁcation is sent to the Plutus Internal 
Server. 
The PlutusDEX platform, illustrated in Figure 4, consists of two main components: 
1. The PlutusDEX dApp that runs on the Ethereum 
network.

========3========

Figure 3: The Plutus Payment Network 
2. Applications that form a bridge between 
Ethereum and the traditional payment in- 
frastructure. 
The PlutusDEX platform features the utilization of Ethereum dApps to execute trades between app users and traders in a peer-to-peer system. The DEX dApp matches bids for Bitcoin and Plutons. The platform itself supports ﬁat deposits and oﬀers traders access to purchase Bitcoin directly from app users. 
2.2 Plutus Mobile App 
The Plutus Mobile App (Figure 5) connects users di- rectly to PlutusDEX traders on the Ethereum net- work. Using the Plutus internal server, the Bitcoin network can be reached using the native Bitcoin API, which is connected to via the Java API (ethereumj), or alternatively, the Javascript API (web3). 
The Plutus Mobile App enables the user to choose among a selection of diﬀerent ﬁat currencies. A vir- tual debit card account can be created in GBP, USD, or EUR, allowing the user to have multiple payment options. 
2.2.1 Plutus App Fee Optimization 
Bitcoin conversion has a fee of between 1-4% (TBD). The fee is deducted from the users’ ﬁat deposit bal- ance before the money is released to their VDC ac- count on the Plutus Mobile App. There are no other fees for using the app and no fee to deposit Plutons on the app obtained from another user externally. Plu- tus pays all transaction costs associated with using the Ethereum network (See Section 2.4.2). Merchants pay their normal debit card payment processing fees. 
2.3 Plutus Payment Process 
The Plutus payment process (Figure 6) consists of two main actions: 
1. The Plutus Mobile App initiates a wireless pay- 
ment to the merchants NFC-enabled payment 
terminal through the user’s NFC-enabled smart- 
phone. 
2. The users VDC payment authorization is sent to 
the merchants payment processor, and once ap- 
proved, the funds are deposited to the merchants

bank account. The user and the merchant, re- spectively, receive conﬁrmation of a successful transaction. 
2.4 Pluton Token Infrastructure 
Plutons are the internal digital asset of Plutus and are issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Pluton trans- actions can be sent and received using the Plutus Mobile App, similarly to Bitcoin. Plutons have the added beneﬁt of zero transaction fees, as well as in- stant transaction conﬁrmations. 
Ownership of Plutons is tied to an Ethereum ac- count. Pluton token source code — running on the production Ethereum network (networkid 1) — acts as a decentralized and distributed ledger of all Plu- ton transactions and the addressed location of every Pluton. The beneﬁts of using Ethereums blockchain is its reliability, underwritten by Ethereums built-in incentives for securing the blockchain. This ensures the continuity, integrity and security of the Pluton ledger. 
The Ethereum network supports near-instant conﬁr- mations of Pluton transactions. According to the lat- 
est data, the average time for a new transaction to be conﬁrmed on the blockchain is approximately 17 seconds. This enables users to convert their digital assets to ﬁat currency in nearly an instant. 
2.4.1 Pluton Rebate System 
Plutus Mobile App users are rewarded with a rebate, at a predetermined rate, of Plutons for every Bitcoin- to-ﬁat exchange they make in order to ﬁll their VDC balance. Plutons can be exchanged for ﬁat currency that is then instantly credited to the users contact- less balance. There is no rebate reward given for ex- changes of Pluton and ﬁat currencies. 
The Pluton Rebate System (Figure 7) is implemented on the Ethereum network and regulated by the DEX. Plutons received as rebate rewards are distributed au- tomatically by the DEX to Plutus Mobile App users. 
There will be 20,000,000 total Plutons in existence. As the trading begins for Plutons on the DEX net- work, the exchange rate, EP, will ﬂuctuate according to market conditions. Its general equation can be described as the amount of Plutons, Pt, required to 
6 

========6========

Figure 7: The Plutus Rebate System 
trade for one Bitcoin, or 
EP = 
Pt 
1BT C 
(1) 
Bid orders for Plutons are made via the trading fron- tend. The PlutusDEX trading API will be open source. It will enable the participation of users on the DEX network once they have been veriﬁed on the frontend. 
Users can buy Plutons, as well as Bitcoin, using the DEX. Plutons earned via rebates can be transferred on the blockchain and have no restrictions on use with in the payment system. Users can transfer Plutons to other users or trade them for ﬁat currency, which is sent to the users VDC balance for in-store purchases. Plutons are implemented as a Transferable Fungibles e.g. sub-currency on Ethereum, using the standard Ethereum API. 
Since rebate rewards are only dispersed when con- verting Bitcoin to ﬁat money we must utilise the vari- 
able exchange rate of, EBT C, Bitcoin to the British Pounds, expressed as 
EBT C = 
1BT C 
TtGBP 
(2) 
where Tt represents the current amount of British Pounds required to purchase one Bitcoin as dictated by the market. 
Let Ti symbolize a single transaction by a single user, worth no more than a maximum value of £30. Mul- tiplying Ti by equation (1) yields the Bitcoin value, Bi, of the given transaction, 
Bi = EBT C ∗ Ti 
(3) 
where Ti ≤ £30. 
The rebate reward rate, R, changes every 24 hours ac- cording to the previous days aggregate Bitcoin trans- action volume, V 
△, expressed as 
 
n V 
△ 
= B△i 
i=1 
(4) 
7 

========7========

where the symbol, △, in the superscript indicates that it represents data from the previous day. The previous days aggregate Bitcoin transaction volume is obtained above by summation of each instance of equation (3) on the previous day. 
The rebate reward rate is determined by an algorithm (Figure 8), where R is a dependent variable to V 
△ 
by adapting and modifying the model of a step function to a non-Boolean use. The indicator function of R is deﬁned as the interval expression, IV △, with the subscript, V 
△ 
, of equation (4), which acts as the interval parameter function of the next days rebate reward rate, deﬁned by the expression 
R := IV △(R) (5) 
The interval parameter function is deﬁned by the variable values of R, which are dependent on the cor- responding range of the previous days Bitcoin trans- action volume, V 
△. 
IV △(R) := {Ri, mi ≤ V 
△ 
≤ Mi 
(6) 
The rebate rate, Ri, in the above expression repre- sents the general structure of the parameters that describe every possible value. Each daily rebate rate, Ri, must diﬀerentiate from the previous days rate,△ 
R , by ±0.01%, while Mi − mi = 0.1BT C at each step. The maximum rebate rate is set at 3% when the daily volume is 5 BTC or less and 1% when the daily volume is 25 BTC or more. Thus, each daily increase in volume of 0.1 BTC will reduce the rebate rate by 0.01%, and vice-versa. 
The PlutusDEX dApp calculates the previous 24hr Bitcoin deposit volume on the network to determine the rebate amount for the following 24hrs on the app. This data is relayed to the Pluton issuer code and the change is aﬀected immediately. 
Now that the rebate reward rate, R, has been found above, we can ﬁnd the amount of Pluton, Pi, for one users single transaction by multiplying the results of equation (1), equation (3), and the current exchange rate, R△, to ﬁnd 
Pi = EP ∗ Bi ∗ R△ 
(7) 
The rebate reward rate has the delta in its superscript to indicate that it was calculated using the previous days Bitcoin transaction volume as expressed in equa- tion (5). 
Finally, we can calculate the total Pluton dispersed to users for an entire day, Pday, by summation of the results obtained from equation (3) and equation (7) and simplifying to obtain the emission equation: 
 
n 
Pday = R ∗ (Pi ∗ Bi) (8) 
i=1 
2.4.2 Smart Contracts & Functionality 
On the Ethereum blockchain, dApps are regulated by their underlying code, commonly called a smart con- tract. Plutus has several types of interacting contract code, each with an important function. Each instance can be called via the internal infrastructure, the Plu- tus web-application (client side), and/or the Plutus Mobile App. When an instance is called, the result is transmitted, asynchronously, as an Ethereum event. 
These events will handle all Plutus transactions be- tween traders and users; will register new deposits of ﬁat currency; and will regulate the issuance of new Pluton tokens, earned by users as rebates. Ev- ery time a Plutus smart contract is called, a small amount of Ether must be payed as a transaction fee for Ethereum miners. This fee is known as the Gas Price and is paid for by Plutus. 
Each instance of a Plutus smart contract is explained in more detail below. Their interactions are illus- trated in Figure 9: 
ˆ Plutus User Contract: This is created for each user and each trader who register. Users can register through the Plutus Mobile App. Due to Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules, users must identify themselves using the Plutus central ser- vice, or through an external service such as Uport. The user contract itself will contain a limited amount of logic, but it does reference other smart contracts such as PlutusDEX con- tract and the Pluton token contract. 
ˆ PlutusDEX Contract: Enables users to exchange Plutons, ﬁat currency and Bitcoin. Traders can deposit ﬁat money using the Plutus central- ized web-application. After veriﬁcation by the Plutus internal infrastructure, users can trade by directly interacting with the smart contract through the standard client provided by Plutus, or by using a custom client. 
ˆ Pluton Token Contract: Determines the Pluton balance of every user on the Pluton network and

uses the standard Ethereum API where appli- cable. Users can view their balance and create Pluton transactions using a wallet that supports the transferable fungibles standard, through the plutons.sol ABI deﬁnition. For example: see Mist Wallet 0.3.5 (Beta 3) release. 
ˆ Plutus Issuer Contract: Regulates the amount 
of Plutons issued as rebate rewards for Plutus 
users. The contract uses the process detailed in 
Section 2.4.1. Rewards are based on the amount 
of Bitcoin that a user trades for ﬁat currency 
each day. Only Plutus central can issue rebates. 
ˆ Name Registry Contract: Holds the addresses 
of all active Plutus smart contracts, and allows 
other smart contracts to call it to return spe- 
ciﬁc addresses on the Ethereum blockchain. See 
namereg.sol for example code.

2.5 Virtual Debit Card Gateway 
A DEX trader transfers ﬁat funds to the Plutus es- crow account prior to entering trade information. Only the Plutus virtual debit card gateway applica- tion can release the ﬁat balance to a virtual debit card token. This is a secure token used for authorization, which is sent to the merchant’s payment processor via the NFC mobile device. The ﬁat amount is re- leased to the merchants bank-account via the debit card payment network, once the trade has been com- pleted. 
The app user preloads his VDC using Bitcoin. The request is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ren- dering it transparent and decentralized. This request is handled by the DEX, which sends the traders pay- out address to the Plutus Mobile App. The app then transfers Bitcoin directly to the payout address pro- vided by the trader. 
Since public addresses of traders are published on blockchains, and therefore known to the Plutus plat- form, the Plutus platform can verify that the amount transferred to the traders accounts is correct before releasing the ﬁat balance accordingly. The VDC- provider receives the ﬁat amount and loads balance to the customers VDC. 
The app is designed for small day to day payments only. It has a deposit limit for diﬀerent account types and a per transaction limit of £30 in the UK (min- imum transaction limit changes according to loca- tion). Users will be advised to only deposit what they wish to spend. In case of user error where the deposit amount is more or less than the requested amount, the smart contract will notify Plutus of the anomaly and fund the users VDC account accordingly. 
Note: Traders receiving deposits have veriﬁed identi- ties using KYC/AML procedures and have ﬁat funds secured in escrow. There is a minimum balance limit for traders on the DEX to protect against anomalies linking to incorrect deposit amounts.

Abstract   
FirstBlood.io (“FirstBlood”) is an upcoming decentralized eSports gaming app that will  allow individuals to test their skill and compete in 1v1 and team vs team matches for  popular online games, such as League of Legends, Dota 2, and Counter­Strike: Global  Offensive.   
Autonomous  
FirstBlood’s innovations will allow skill based competition to take place independent of  middlemen,  such  as  financial  institutions  or  casinos. The  cryptocurrency  Ethereum  allows for the creation of smart contracts that run business logic autonomously in the  blockchain. These smart contracts can be used for fast, secure and reliable processing  of results and rewards from competitive eSports matchplays. Unlike existing platforms  (which are both skill and game of chance­based), all of FirstBlood’s transactions are  publicly  verifiable,  viewable,  resistant  to  counterfeit,  and  not  subject  to  the  risk of  institutional processing.   
Decentralized  
Traditional online businesses with centralized structures are subject to hacking, strict  financial  regulations,  and  onerous  overhead  costs.  Peer­to­Peer  (“P2P”)  decentralization allows skill based competition without reliance on payment processors,  reduces operational regulatory burdens, and protects against organizational corruption  such as fraud and embezzlement.   
Fully Automated  
Each match outcome will be automatically verified by two groups: Witnesses, and/or the  Jury Voting Pool (“JVP”). Witnesses are people running the automated Witness node  software that verifies and reports game results. Payouts will be rewarded to the winner  based on  player  reports  and  Witness  checks. This  significantly reduces  the  risk of  fraudulent reporting that is rampant on similar platforms.

Organizing eSports tournaments is a key strategic component for top Multiplayer Online  Battle Arena (“MOBA”) and First­Person Shooter (“FPS”) games, which have earned a  combined  $1.6B  in  revenues  year­to­date.1  MOBA  and  FPS  MMO  (Massively  Multiplayer  Online)  players  ​spend  more  on  gaming­related  expenditures  than  the  average gamer, globally, converting into​  paying customers this year at a rate of 7.7%  and 10.8%2,​ respectively. Studios have capitalized on this: since Riot began officially  sanctioning League of Legends tournaments in 2011, the game’s annual revenue has  increased from $85.3M to a whopping $1.2B projected by year’s end.3  
  
The global eSports market generated $748M​  in revenue in 2015E, and is expected to  grow to ​$1.9B by 2018E. ​North America and Europe comprise 52% of the market as  they  continue  to  rapidly  invest  in  the space.4 One​

In 2015E, Betting & Fantasy sites, Prize pools and Tournaments revenues amounted to  roughly $56M, $54M, and $28M respectively, totaling $138M, and is expected to grow  to  $350M  by  2018E.7  This  enormous  growth  potential  presents  FirstBlood  with  a  compelling opportunity to capitalize on the growing interest of eSports enthusiasts who  want to be more involved in the action.  
  
A third of fans don’t just want to watch eSports, they also want to compete.8    
On average, eSports fans compete in four live tournaments every six months.9  This can  be inconvenient for frequent competitors. Likewise, nearly half of eSports enthusiasts  bet  on  sports matches every week.10  They would like to be able to compete online  through a trusted operator. Currently, there are only flawed solutions to the problem,  and none support a seamless customer experience. Problems ranging from confusing  user­interfaces  (“UI”),  to  potential  for  fraud,  have  prevented  current  operators  from  reaching full potential.  
  
FirstBlood’s decentralized  online  platform  will provide an environment for gamers to  compete without the problems associated with the current market offerings.  
Opportunity   
The global eSports market is growing prodigiously, with an expected compound annual  growth rate (“CAGR”) of 37%.11  By 2018, the eSports market is expected to generate  $1.92B in global revenue.12  Additionally, 33% of eSports fans don’t just want to watch,  they also want to compete.13  Based on these figures, a market capture of merely 0.5%  would produce an estimated $70,445,000 in platform volume for FirstBlood by 2018 just  from competitive matchmaking.

automated platform.    
Through  decentralization,  participants  are  completely in  control  of  their  funds while  using FirstBlood. The payments and payouts are made by the individual players and  cleared on the Ethereum blockchain without ever being processed by a bank or any  third party institution. This decentralized model reduces transaction and other operating  costs. These savings will be passed on to the consumer, adding value that competitors  cannot  provide.  Existing  centralized  solutions  place  consumers  at  risk.  Players’  centralized accounts and deposits can be hacked, embezzled, or even confiscated with  little recourse for those affected. With FirstBlood, users are completely in control of their  assets with no involvement of third party institutions.  
  
Smart contracts paired with a decentralized jury and witness system allow FirstBlood to  operate in a unique way that has never existed before, and to be independent from  game API policy changes. If a dispute arises that requires a higher level of scrutiny,  FirstBlood’s in­house jury system will be activated to adjudicate.

Future Vision  
FirstBlood aims to be the preferred global platform for skill­based eSports competitors  and to play an essential part in shaping the future of blockchain­based projects. This  project will initially focus on one gaming community, but will expand to include all of the  major  competitive  eSports  games. Ultimately,  FirstBlood  will  be  a  leading  brand  in  competitive eSports, affiliated with P2P gaming as well as influential regional and global  tournaments.  FirstBlood  will  also  work  with  game  developers by  forming  symbiotic  relationships to enhance the gaming experience for all users. Doing so will encourage a  higher level of participation on both parties’ platforms and bring cryptocurrencies and  decentralized applications one step closer to mainstream.  
Licensing  
Due to transparent nature of smart contracts, much of the intellectual property will be  open source.   
App Token  
FirstBlood Token (“1SŦ”) is an essential part of the FirstBlood ecosystem and economy.  The four major utilities available to FirstBlood Token holders are:   
● Playing matches  
● Witnessing matches and voting on the jury  
● Hosting tournaments  
● Claiming rewards from referrals

Token Acquisition  
As  a utility  token, 1SŦ  is involved  in  every process of the ecosystem. 1SŦ can be  acquired  through  FirstBlood’s  native  app,  from  another  player  via  transfer,  through  playing competitive matches with players, from fulfilling jury duty or Witness duty after  participants acquire 1SŦ, or from claiming referral rewards. Users will have the ability to  acquire 1SŦ by sending Ether (“ETH”) to the 1SŦ creation contract on the blockchain  during  a  pre­sale. The FirstBlood interface will integrate third party trading solutions  such as Shapeshift and Coinbase for users who don’t have ETH.   
Token Pre­sale  
The FirstBlood Token initial distribution will be in the form of a pre­sale. Anyone will be  able  to acquire  1SŦ  at  a  discount  rate  by  pledging  ETH  into the token sale smart  contract. People who have other cryptocurrencies such as ETC, BTC or STEEM17  can  create 1SŦ via a third­party conversion service that will be available on the pre­sale  page.  The sale will last four weeks from 9/26/2016 to 10/24/2016. These dates are  approximate,  as  the  actual  start  and  end  time  will  correspond  to  Ethereum  block  numbers.   
  
The first hour of the sale will be  
a  Power  Hour.  At  this  time,  
tokens will be available at a rate  
of 170 1SŦ to 1 ETH. Then the  
rate will change to 150 1SŦ to 1  
ETH.  Every  week,  the rate will  
decrease linearly until it hits 100  
1SŦ to 1 ETH.   
  
The token sale will have a hard  
cap  that,  when  reached,  will  
immediately  disable  additional  
sales. The cap will be measured  
in  Ether  and  set  in  the  token  
sale  smart  contract  to a value  approximately equal to $5.5 million USD based on the ETH/USD price at the start of the  token sale.

At the end of the sale, the founding team will receive a 10% allocation of 1SŦ, subject to  a twelve month holding period. These tokens will serve as long­term incentive for the  FirstBlood founding team. An additional 5% will be allocated to an eSports ecosystem  fund to be used for promotions and eSports tournament rewards. 2,500,000 1SŦ will be  allocated  to  a  FirstBlood  bounty  fund.  The  bounty  fund  will  be  used  for  pre­sale  marketing and bug bounties. At the end of the pre­sale, token creation will be closed  permanently. Token transfers will be restricted for two months after the sale ends.  
Playing Matches  
The FirstBlood platform is web and desktop software that allows users to interact with  the FirstBlood smart contracts. 1SŦ can be used as  
stake  in  competitive  eSports  matches  on  the  
platform.  Users  will  have  the  ability  to  send  their  
stake  to  a  smart  contract  that  acts  as  a  
decentralized  escrow.  The  smart  contract  handles  
the  matchmaking  and  reward  settlement  after  the  
match  is  processed  by  a  decentralized  result  
verification system.  
Match Result Verification  
A  decentralized  result  verification  system  is  
beneficial because it is resistant to game API policy changes, fraud from subjective  reporting, and certain criminal activities. All 1SŦ holders have the right to help determine  match outcomes by witnessing matches and voting in the JVP.   
  
A  match  result can be either contested or uncontested. A match is contested if the  opponents  disagree  about  the  result  of  the  match.  A  match  is  uncontested  if  the  opponents  agree  about  the  result  of  the  match.  Whether  a  match is  contested or  uncontested, it needs to be confirmed by two Witnesses.   
Witnesses  
A Witness is a special role in the match verification system. In order to act as a Witness,  a  1SŦ  holder  must  run automated  Witness  node software. Witness  nodes  are  the  curators of matches. They serve as the final gateway before matches and rewards are  processed. The network of Witness nodes act as a decentralized proxy that has the

In order to be part of the pool of possible Witnesses, 1SŦ holders need to opt in by  sending a transaction to the smart contract. For each match, approximately two Witness  nodes are chosen by a weighted random selection process and awarded 1SŦ for their  services. Specifically, the Witness node software looks at each match assigned to it,  checks game APIs for official results, and sends the results to the blockchain for all to  see. The Witness node software is completely automated, thus, people running Witness  node software do not need to intervene in any way.

One of the perks of holding 1SŦ is the ability to receive compensation for fulfilling jury  duty. In the event a match is contested, two Witnesses will be required. Some members  of the JVP will be randomly selected as members of the jury. In order to be considered  a member of the JVP, 1SŦ holders need to opt in by sending a transaction to the smart  contract using the graphical user interface (GUI). All 1SŦ holders are recommended to  be opted­in so they can get rewarded by the system and so that the platform can better  handle  high  match  volume.  Jury  members  will  be  selected  by  the same  weighted  random selection processes used for Witnesses.  
  
  
If a member of the JVP has been selected to sit on a jury, that juror may submit one  vote to influence the outcome of the dispute. The juror’s decision should be based on  the  results  provided  by the  Witnesses,  and  any additional evidence or screenshots  submitted by the players. FirstBlood will provide software to make it easy for players to  provide evidence of their result. Once the desired quorum has been reached, the winner  will receive the reward. For example, if one hundred people are selected in the JVP,  
and the quorum is twenty, then twenty jurors must submit their vote before a case is  considered resolved. A fraction of the reward will be paid to FirstBlood, and a fraction of  
10  

========11========

Private & Confidential  
the reward will be paid to the Witnesses and any jury members who voted with the  majority.  Members  of the jury who voted with the minority may be penalized with a  negative reward.  
Sybil Attack Prevention  
Because 1SŦ relies on a decentralized JVP to give rewards to the true winners, it is  important to avoid corruption through Sybil Attacks by automatically created accounts. It  would be harmful if one person used multiple accounts to get multiple seats on a jury.  Likewise, it would be unfavorable if one group of users bought more 1SŦ than everyone  else  and  managed  to  control  juries  by  dominating the  weighted  selection  process.  FirstBlood has solutions for both of these cases:  
  
1. In order to opt in to the JVP, users must provide identity information such as first  
name, email or cell (could be activated for two­factor authentication (2FA)) to  
FirstBlood. This way, FirstBlood can ensure that each person has one unique  
account being used to participate in the JVP.  
  
2. While the probability of being selected for jury duty is proportional to number of  
tokens, this probability is capped at 1% per account. This way, FirstBlood can  
ensure no one is able to dominate the jury selection process. A user is free to  
purchase more than 1% of the token supply (for instance, to use in matches), but  
the probability will be capped at 1%.  
Dynamic Reward Formulas  
The  desired  jury  size,  quorum  size,  
rewards and penalties all may change as  
necessary.  As  they  become  available,  
FirstBlood will provide formulas so users  
can plan accordingly.  
  
For  example,  in  order  to  ensure  
FirstBlood’s  ability  to  scale  when  more  
matches are being played at a given time,  
a  Dynamic Reward Mechanism (“DRM”)  
will be implemented at the smart contract  
level.  Rewards  for  running  a  Witness  
node or voting accurately on a jury can vary dynamically based on how many cases are  
11

available versus the processing speed at a given time. Similar to a ride­sharing app,  with surge pricing to incentivize drivers, FirstBlood has its own floating reward structure.  As match volume surges, so does the reward percentage for Witnesses and members  of the JVP.  
Hosting Tournaments  
Another utility of 1SŦ is the ability to initiate tournaments on the platform. Tournaments  can be competitive matches between individuals or teams. These tournaments can be  an array of prearranged matches (bracketed, charity,  
free­to­play) handled by the same mechanism using  
JVP  and  Witness  nodes.  The  1SŦ  tournament  
creation function will be one of the main pillars of the  
FirstBlood  eSports  ecosystem  by  attracting  new  
users to become 1SŦ holders in the network.   
Referral Rewards  
Another way to acquire 1SŦ is by inviting friends to  
become active users on FirstBlood’s platform. Once  
the friend has played his or her first competitive match on the platform, the referrer will  earn a referral reward.  
eSports Federation  
The future vision for the FirstBlood Ecosystem extends far beyond our rewards platform.  We  aim  for  the  FirstBlood token to be redeemable for goods and services within a  partnered  network  of  retailers,  DAPPS,  and  other  participants  associated  with  FirstBlood. The team aims to be proactive in scouting synergetic projects that share the  same values of innovation in the eSports industry.  
Gamification Design  
FirstBlood will implement a gamification element by introducing concepts like Global  Ranking (leaderboard style) and Match­making Ranking (“MMR”).   
12  

========13========

Private & Confidential  
Global Ranking  
A  global  ranking  system  will  be  viewable  on  FirstBlood’s  platform  to  encourage  competition among eSports players. Ranks will be awarded based on achievements  such as special activities, “killing streaks”, and FirstBlood competition wins.   
Lessons and Mentorships  
Once a high enough rank is achieved by a player on the platform, the veteran player will  be able to mentor less­experienced players. The 1SŦ stake that is normally put up for a  match will become payment for the lesson. This will allow the less experienced players  to feel that they have the ability to succeed on the platform.  
Matchmaking Ranking   
A player’s Matchmaking Ranking (“MMR”) will be adjusted after every match. The MMR  adjustment will depend on the current MMR of the player and the opponent. Winning a  match can increase a player’s MMR by up to 39 points, while losing can decrease a  player’s MMR by up to 39 points. The MMR gained or lost by one player in a match will  be the opposite of the gain or loss of his opponent. Here is a sample formula:    
var​ calcMMR ​=​ ​function(​MMR1​ ​,​ MMR2){​   
var adjustment ​ ​=​ (​​Number(​MMR1​ )​ ​­​ ​Number​ (​MMR2​ ))​ ​ ​/​ ​20​;  
var s1 ​ =​​ ​20 ​­​​ ​Math​.min​ ​(Math​ .​max​ (​​adjustment,​ ​­​​19),​  ​​19);​   
return​ [​adjustment​ ,​ s1​ ​];  
};  
User Reputation System  
FirstBlood  will  have  a  User  Reputation  System  (“URS”)  to  protect  players,  restrict  hackers/criminals,  and  encourage  healthy  competition.  This  URS  will  be  present in  every aspect of the user experience, from initial sign­ups to professional tournament  play. Newly­joined players will have to gain reputation to build trust in the community.  The URS  will incorporate public  ranking  with achievements to allow users to easily  identify  players  who may  have a  history of  abusing  other  players  or  hacking.  This  method  could  reduce  abusive  cases  handled  by  the  JVP.  Likewise,  the  URS  will  enhance  the  competitive  experience  by  encouraging  players  to  level up  and  build  reputation.

========14========

Reputation Incentive  
FirstBlood’s URS can provide incentive for users to behave nicely and discourage toxic  or malicious users from registering multiple accounts. The platform matchmaking engine  (based on MMR) gives higher matching priority to users with higher reputation score.  Each individual user will also have the ability to set the minimum reputation threshold for  joining a specific match on the GUI level. Having a better reputation also allows users to  play at higher levels with larger stakes.  
Platform Design  
Applications UI/UX  
Screenshot of FirstBlood prototype as of July, 2016.   
  
FirstBlood is a platform for players to compete with each other and win rewards. FirstBlood is  developing  a  unique  application  interface  that  propagates  its  branding  and  provides  an  easy­to­navigate user experience (UX).  
  
The typical  UX  begins  with  registering  a  new account via the account creation process,  followed  by a guided tutorial of the platform, shown after the account is verified through  email.

Matches must be easy for users to join, making it essential to provide the interface on both  web and mobile platforms. FirstBlood’s plans incorporate an agile cross­platform framework  to reduce redundant work on specific OS­focused development.   
Desktop App  
​ 
FirstBlood plans to use an agile framework to create a native application that runs on players’  desktops. ​Electron18, a framework for creating native applications with web technologies such  as  JavaScript,  HTML,  and  CSS,  could  underpin  a  desktop  application.  This  type  of  framework will enable the team to focus on the core of FirstBlood’s business. For example,  Atom text editor, Slack desktop app, and Mist Wallet are some popular apps that are built  using this framework.  
App Architecture  
● The user interface will be a single page app.  
● The interface will allow the user to create an account by funding a new Ethereum  
address with Ether via an established payment processor.  
● The user will then be able to create a username for this account, and the account  
information  will  be  stored  locally  in  browser  storage  (cookies).  The  user  will  be  
encouraged to write down the Ethereum account and private key as a backup.  ● In order to encourage new users who aren’t familiar with Ethereum, FirstBlood will  
officially support MetaMask, a Chrome plugin that simplifies the process of getting an  
Ethereum account and allows users to avoid running an Ethereum node locally.

1SŦ  and  the  FirstBlood  network  are  based  upon the  Ethereum  protocol. As  such, any  malfunction, unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum protocol may  cause  the  FirstBlood  network  or  1SŦ  to  malfunction  or  function  in  an  unexpected  or  unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum Protocol may itself lose  value in ways similar to 1SŦ, and also other ways. More information about the Ethereum  protocol is available at http://www.ethereum.org.  
3) Risks Associated with Voting  
The purchaser may lose 1SŦ by exercising votes maliciously or carelessly.    
  
4) Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials  
Any third party that gains access to the purchaser’s login credentials or private keys may be  able to dispose of the purchaser’s 1SŦ. To minimize this risk, the purchaser should guard  against unauthorized access to their electronic devices.

5) Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions  
Blockchain  technologies  have  been the  subject  of  scrutiny  by  various  regulatory bodies  around the world. The functioning of the FirstBlood network and 1SŦ could be impacted by  one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use  or possession of digital tokens like 1SŦ, which could impede or limit the development of the  FirstBlood network.  
6) Risk of Alternative, Unofficial FirstBlood Networks  
Following the presale and the development of the initial version of the 1SŦ platform, it is  possible that alternative networks could be established, which utilize the same open source  code  and  open source protocol underlying the FirstBlood network. The official FirstBlood  network  may  compete with these alternative, unofficial 1SŦ­based networks, which could  potentially negatively impact the FirstBlood network and 1SŦ.  
7) Risk of Insufficient Interest in the FirstBlood Network or Distributed Applications  
It is possible that the FirstBlood network will not be used by a large number of businesses,  individuals,  and  other  organizations  and  that  there  will be  limited public  interest  in  the  creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the  development of the FirstBlood network and therefore the potential uses or value of 1SŦ.  
8) Risk that the FirstBlood Network, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of  
Purchaser  
The FirstBlood network is presently under development and may undergo significant  changes before release. Any expectations regarding the form and functionality of 1SŦ or  the FirstBlood network held by the purchaser may not be met upon release, for any  number  of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and  execution of the FirstBlood network.  
9) Risk of Theft and Hacking  
Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the FirstBlood network  or the availability of 1SŦ in any number of ways, including without limitation denial of service  attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus­based attacks.

10) Risk of Security Weaknesses in the 1SŦ network Core Infrastructure Software  
The FirstBlood network consists of open­source software that is itself based on open­source  software. There is a risk that the FirstBlood team, or other third parties may intentionally or  unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the  FirstBlood network interfering with the use of or causing the loss of 1SŦ.  
11) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography  
Advances  in  cryptography,  or  technical  advances such  as  the  development  of  quantum  computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the FirstBlood platform, which could  result in the theft or loss of 1SŦ.  
12) Risk of 1SŦ Mining Attacks  
As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used  for  the  FirstBlood  network  is  susceptible  to  mining  attacks,  including  but not  limited  to  double­spend  attacks,  majority  mining  power  attacks,  “selfish­mining”  attacks,  and  race  condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the FirstBlood network, expected  proper execution and sequencing of FirstBlood markets, and expected proper execution and  sequencing of Ethereum contract computations. Despite the efforts of the FirstBlood Team,  the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists.  
13) Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the FirstBlood Network  
While 1SŦ should not be viewed as an investment, it may have value over time. That value  may be limited if the FirstBlood network lacks use and adoption. If this becomes the case,  there may be few or no markets upon the launch of the platform, limiting the value of 1SŦ.  
14) Risk of an Illiquid Market for 1SŦ  
There  are  currently  no  exchanges  upon  which  1SŦ  might  trade.  If  ever  exchanges  do  develop,  they  will  likely  be  relatively  new  and  subject  to  poorly­understood  regulatory  oversight.  They  may  therefore  be  more  exposed  to  fraud  and  failure  than  established,  regulated exchanges for other products. To the extent that the exchanges representing a  substantial portion of the volume in 1SŦ trading are involved in fraud or experience security  failures or other operational issues, such exchanges’ failures may result in a reduction in the  value or liquidity of 1SŦ.

15) Risk of Uninsured Losses  
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using the  FirstBlood or Ethereum network are generally uninsured. In the event of loss or loss of value,  there is no public insurer, such as the F.D.I.C., or private insurer, to offer recourse to the  purchaser.  
16) Risk of Dissolution of the FirstBlood Project  
It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including without limitation an unfavorable  fluctuation in the value of Bitcoin, unfavorable fluctuation in the value of 1SŦ, the failure of  business relationships, or competing intellectual property claims, the FirstBlood project may  no longer be a viable business and may dissolve or fail to launch.  
17) Risk of Malfunction in the FirstBlood Network  
It is possible that the FirstBlood network malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including but  not limited to one that results in the loss of 1SŦ, or information concerning a market.  
18) Unanticipated Risks  
Cryptocurrency and cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to  the risks set forth here, there are risks that the FirstBlood team cannot anticipate. Risks may  further materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the risks set forth here.
