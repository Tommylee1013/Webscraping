       "'17 Oct 2016 \\nhack.ether.camp \\nVirtual Accelerator \\nAbstract \\nOur goal is to create the ideal innovation environment for startups by  utilising blockchain technology for the release of the Virtual Accelerator. \\n\\n========1========\\n\\nIntroduction   \\n“If you look at history, innovation doesn\\'t come  just from giving people incentives; it comes  from creating environments where their ideas  can connect.” \\n- Steven Johnson \\nYear 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto started the Bitcoin project [Nakamoto 2009]. This frst  blockchain made possible a completely autonomous fnance system. \\nYear 2014, a team of blockchain enthusiasts started project Ethereum, a revolutionary  technology making it possible to create essentially any type of autonomously directed  blockchain-based object. \\nYear 2016, we are starting the Virtual Accelerator (VA) to provide transparent and true  acceleration to blockchain developers around the world. \\nThe technology of blockchain and smart contracts allows for transparent evaluation  and ranking via tokens that allow holders to refect their conviction for an idea for  development. \\nCrowdfunding projects have become a popular method to raise funding at the early  stages of a project (Massolution [2015]), but generally the early backers don’t receive  anything more than the frst version of the product. \\nA better approach is to enable those that identify the value in an initiative at the  beginning to evidence their conviction using units of uniform value. That’s what our  platform facilitates. \\nThe rights of early adopters who support an idea and project at the initial stages are  enforced by the Solidity [Reitwiessner 2015] smart contract deployed to the Ethereum  blockchain. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========2========\\n\\nIdeas   \\n“If you can dream it,  you can do it.”  \\n- Walt Disney \\nThe seed of each successful company begins with an idea. The idea requires a team  of people to turn it into a prototype or MVP. A prototype needs user input from early  adopters to iterate and improve it until users are actually willing to pay for the features  they want. This is the path followed by many startups as they have become today’s  successful companies. The chain of success always starts with  an initial link of an  idea. \\nThe Virtual Accelerator registration opens months before the start of the event and we  encourage hackers to share their ideas publicly. A well explained idea is the best way  to get other people passionate and ask to join your team. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========3========\\n\\nHackers \\n“Every child is an artist. The problem is how to  remain an artist once we grow up.” \\n- Pablo Picasso \\nThe Virtual Accelerator is a platform that allows for the presentation, testing and  launch of ideas. It’s a place that fosters new startups. \\nThe frst step is to build a team. We encourage people to use the platform to fnd  teammates based on mutual interests, shared values and complementary skill sets. \\nOnce a team is in place, and the vision for the project is clear, the next step is to attract  early adopters. These are people who will try out the prototype, express interest in the  product and commit to the future roadmap. \\nAttracting early adopters is important as it proves to the development team that  they’re on the right track. \\nWhat’s unique about the <hack.ether.camp> platform is that early adopters can also  be turned into kickstart backers and fund the project using the tokenizing feature  available \\nto each startup team. (See Early Adopters section for more) \\nThe platform provides an open stage for teams to display and share their work,  allowing the whole community to see how they’re progressing while getting honest  feedback from a panel of experienced judges on their progress and direction. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========4========\\n\\nJudges    \\n“The more original a discovery, the more   obvious it seems afterwards.” \\n- Arthur Koestler \\nAs the event provides the potential for great ideas and projects to fourish and  materialise, we have invited a broad range of judges from various industries and  disciplines to provide feedback and direction to the teams. \\nThe judges are there to help provide the teams with motivation, with their votes  indicating that a team is making the right decisions. \\n• \\nEach judge has a total of 1000 kudos which they can award across various teams.  Voting will commence one week after the event has started. \\n• \\nRegular fans also have the right to vote and are provided with 10 kudos to issue to  the team or teams they see with the most potential. \\nFans can also increase the amount of kudos they have by providing proof of their  identity via their Facebook and / or Twitter account. 100 additional kudos votes are  provided for each account added. Overall a fan can therefore have a total of 210  kudos. \\n• \\nVoting on the blockchain is supported by a smart contract ProjectKudos and  described in details in the [Smart Contract Description] appendix. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========5========\\n\\nHacker Gold \\n\"Money never starts an idea; it is the idea that  starts the money.\" \\n- William J. Cameron \\nHacker Gold (HKG) is the offcial token of the Virtual Accelerator. HKG allows anyone  to be involved and signify their appreciation of the best projects participating in the  event. \\nHKG allows you to acquire tokens initiated by the individual startups during the  incubation period of the hackathon. Having these tokens, in turn, provides you with  preferred voting rights on the way that funds are used to develop the applicable  startup’s idea. Startups’ tokens issued after the hackathon do not come with preferred  voting rights. \\nThe amount of HKG collected by an individual team is a de facto crowd expression  of the perceived potential of the project. As such, it provides a baseline for future  crowdfunding by the team once the hackathon is over. The teams who collect the  most HKG will have the largest acceptance by the crowd and will have a clear signal of  the strength of their potential. \\n• \\nFor the duration of the hackathon tokens initiated by startups will be listed on the  virtual exchange that forms part of the <hack.ether.camp> platform and can be  purchased using HKG. \\nThe only way to gain preferred voting rights on a startup’s development is to buy  tokens initiated by that startup during the hackathon event. \\n• \\nThe emission process. HKG will be available for 9 weeks, starting from 4 weeks  before the hackathon starts and ending after the 5 weeks of the event are  complete. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========6========\\n\\nHacker Gold \\nThe price during the emission will be calculated like this: \\n• \\nP1:  Week 1-2: (200 HKG) for 1 Ether. \\n• \\nP2:  Week 2-4: (200 HKG - 150 HKG) for 1 Ether.  \\nThe actual formula when X is the day in P2 : (200 - (X * 3.5)) HKG for 1 Ether    \\n• \\nP3:  Week 5-6: (150 HKG) for 1 Ether  \\n• \\nP4:  Week 7-9: (150 HKG - 100 HKG) for  1 Ether.  \\nThe actual formula when X is the day in P4 : (150 - (X * 3.5)) HKG for 1 Ether \\nNo Premine. \\nThere is no special amount reserved for anyone.   \\nNo Second Emission. \\nHKG will only be available for purchase one time, closing at the end of the second  hackathon (December 2016) event. There will be no second sale. When the Virtual  Accelerator opens to new entrants through future hackathons the only way to  purchase HKG will be on the open market. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========7========\\n\\nHacker Gold \\nHKG trading on exchanges. \\nHKG is expected to be available for open trading on leading altcoin exchanges after  the <hack.ether. camp> event ends. \\nCollected coins:  \\nThe HKG token will refect the success of the Virtual Accelerator, with the ongoing  success of the platform in identifying breakout development teams and ideas  increasing the desire of developer and fans to hold the HKG token. \\nThe Virtual Accelerator platform presented at the time of releasing the white paper is  the 2nd generation version, the 1st generation version of the hackathon platform can  be seen here: \\nhttp://season-1.ether.camp  \\nThe Future  \\nDevelopment on the Virtual Accelerator platform will be ongoing with updated  versions being released periodically. Our goal is to scale the platform and have  frequent competitions, generating more ideas, establishing new teams and forming  new startups. \\nOur mission is to democratise opportunity for everyone, from opening access to  entrepreneurs to early funding for development through to providing a way for  developers and fans in the community to support other startups’ ideas. \\nThe ongoing development and marketing of the Virtual Accelerator will be funded from  the sale of HKG. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========8========\\n\\nBlockChain  Presence \\n\"It\\'s really hard to design products by focus  groups.  A lot of times, people don\\'t know what  they want until you show it to them.\"  \\n- Steve Jobs \\nThe team involved in each startup will have a self-enforcing smart contract that will  guarantee the rights of each person that acquires the tokens initiated by the startup.  This is achieved via the DSTContract, where DST stands for Decentralised Startup  Team. \\nIn this section we will provide an overview of the different aspects of the contract, for  the technical description please refer to the [Smart Contracts Description] appendix. \\nToken offer \\nThe startup is an group of developers looking to fund their project’s R&D activities.  A fundamental aspect of the contract is holding the actual funds collected from the  community. There are 2 stages of fund collection: \\n• \\nOffering tokens during the period of the hackathon. The DST will receive the HKG  token in exchange for the particular token a team is offering. \\n• \\nAfter the hackathon event is over. The DST can receive Ether in exchange for the  particular token a team is offering. \\nYou will fnd more on the tokens value and rest of the funding discussed in [Post  Accelerator Period]. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========9========\\n\\nBlockChain  Presence \\nExecutive Team \\nThis is the core startup team, who have come together to implement an idea that  they all believe in. Teams will vary depending on what they are trying to achieve, but  generally it will be a mix of skills e.g. a lead programmer, UI designer and system  administrator, would be a classic team that could build any prototype for a software  project. \\nThe primary obligation of the team is to drive forward the implementation of the  project. An important factor in this is how to allocate funds to make tangible progress.  Whether the executive team is one person or more, to move the startup forward it  will need to propose how it uses its funds. The ability to do this lies solely with the  executive team as it is responsible for the success or failure of the project. \\nEarly Adopters \\nThe adopters are more than just the people who test the initial versions of a product;  they’re actually real world validation that the project will have users. The valuable  contribution of early adopters is rewarded by providing them with voting rights. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========10========\\n\\nBlockChain  Presence \\nVoting rights \\nCreating a balance between the right of early adopters to infuence the direction of a  startup, against the agility of the executive team to make funding decisions is key. To  allow for this, early adopters will not be asked to approve a proposal but only to refuse  a proposal they object to. \\nIf the executive team presents a proposal to spend X% of the funds, the funds will be  made available after 10 days unless 55% of the votes held by the early adopters object  to the transfer of the funds from the DSTContract. \\n   \\nImpeachment process. \\nIn extreme cases if Early Adopters are not completely happy with what the executive  team is doing they can vote to change the executive team personnel. An impeachment  requires 70% of the voter rights. \\nThe most likely use case in this instance is to return funds. They can appoint a person  who will be responsible for returning the funds according to the share of each involved  person. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========11========\\n\\nPost Accelerator  Period  \\n“The three great essentials to achieve anything  worthwhile are, frst, hard work; second, stick- to-itiveness; third, common sense.” \\n- Thomas A. Edison \\n• \\nAfter the incubation period of the event, the startups continue to evolve their  prototype product into a functioning business by developing more features and  presenting the user base with a product roadmap. \\n• \\nIt’s important to state that <ether.camp> is not claiming any rights over the  startups coming out from the Virtual Accelerator. The blockchain presence of the  startups is completely under the control of their executive team. \\n• \\nThe startup will be allowed to initiate 5X more tokens immediately after the event  is over. Where X is the number of tokens sold during the hackathon event. The  tokens will be available to the general public directly for Ether. Tokens purchased in  the second phase of the crowdfund will not come with preferred voting rights. \\n• \\nThe voting rights that early adopters have been given for HKG tokens acquired  during the Virtual Accelerator will grant some control over the spending of funds  and in very extreme cases changing the executive leaders. [see Blockchain  Presence section] \\n• \\nCollected HKG volatility - Startups can exchange their HKG tokens for leading  cryptocurrencies whether that is Ether or Bitcoin. This process will be made  gradual to encourage startups to continue their own kickstarter process, promoting  the remainder of their tokens for sale. \\nThe HKG volatility of the tokens will be structured as follows:  \\n• \\n2 months after the event is fnished, 50% of the HKG amount will be released. \\n• \\n3rd month will be linear monotonic release of the last 50% of the HKG tokens:  0.03 * 0.5 * (HKG collected). \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========12========\\n\\nProject Kudos   \\n“If you don\\'t know, the thing to do is not to  get scared, but to learn.”  \\n- Ayn Rand \\nThe voting system is a key aspect of the Virtual Accelerator. The platform’s smart  contract system, built on the Ethereum blockchain, allows the community and judges  to best recognise teams achievements. The team with the most kudos at the end of  the competition will win the frst placed prize. \\nVoting will open one week after the event has started. \\nEach person can give a portion of their kudos quota to one or more projects. The  actual voting is done by a blockchain transaction signed with the person\\'s identity so  that it’s transparent and traceable. \\nEach vote given to a project is therefore recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and will  be irreversible. \\nEach registered individual starts with 10 kudos. Users who provide their identity  through Facebook and / or Twitter will receive an additional 100 kudos for each  account. The addition of both accounts will therefore provide a total of 210 kudos.  To reduce the potential for fraud a minimum 100 Facebook friends and 100 Twitter  followers are required. \\nThe details of smart contract: ProjectKudos are described in the [Smart Contract  Description] appendix. \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========13========\\n\\nApendix  \\nSmart Contract Description   \\n“Make something people want“  \\nPaul Graham \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========14========\\n\\nSmart Contract Description \\nThis section describes the Solidity smart contracts utilised by the platform and  running on the Ethereum blockchain. \\nVirtualExchange - dstListed    \\nEventInfo    - start \\n[DSTContract]    - votingRights  - tokenBalances - executive \\n [Hacker Gold]    - tokenBalances \\n[ProjectKudos]  - projects - voters     \\nDiagram - 1 (Contract Relations)   \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========15========\\n\\nEventInfo   \\nDates to denote the <hack.ether.camp> event. \\n  <source code>  will be added soon \\n<ether.camp> \\n\\n========16========\\n\\nDSTContract  \\nDST stands for: Decentralized Startup Team.

INTRODUCTION \\nToday, lottery is the largest social and entertainment game in the world. The share  of lotteries on the world’s gambling market is over 30\\xa0%. The annual turnover of  this market today is $284 billion. Along with the penetration of the Internet and  the growing number of devices connected to a network, the number of users who  prefer playing this game online is growing. Consequently, the online lottery market  today is promising area.  \\nBut despite such popularity, the lotteries currently present on the market cannot  provide the user with a 100\\xa0% guarantee of an honest lottery or offer full transparen- cy with regard to the formation and distribution of the prize fund. It is not surprising  that this issue is a hot topic for discussion on forums and in private conversations  among amateurs who like try their fortune in this game. Unfortunately, at present  one can see licensed operators periodically caught in various sorts of violations re- garding prize fund distribution and the honesty of the lottery. Just as important are  the conditions for receiving awards, which also have a number of shortcomings in  the form of delayed payments and various kinds of commissions. \\nNow, thanks to smart contracts, we have the ability to address these critical issues.  KIBO is a decentralized lottery, the main advantage of which is the complete trans- parency of all processes taking place on the platform and the fundamental absence  of opportunities for fraud. Unlike “fair play checks”, which allow one to check game  results in existing cryptocurrency lotteries, KIBO itself eliminates the potential for  fraud. This is made possible by Ethereum and the concept of smart contracts. The  marketing component of the lottery is also implemented based on smart contracts,  allowing franchise partners and owners of KIBIT tokens to be sure of receiving their  earnings and the correctness of its calculation.  \\nKIBO is a platform where all processes are implemented and managed by smart  contracts. Ticket purchase, random number generation, and prize payouts, as well  as accruals in the distributed partner network, are performed by a smart contract  without the possibility of intervention by third parties.   Changes in the platform are  made by a vote of control token holders \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n01 \\n\\n========2========\\n\\nETHEREUM AS THE BASIS FOR IMPLEMENTATION \\nFor implementation of the project, the Ethereum [2] decentralized network, which  uses the concept of “smart contracts”, was chosen. Ethereum has great potential  for scaling [3] and the broad support of the cryptocommunity and investors. Cur- rently, the network is theoretically capable of handling about 10 transactions per  second; this is enough to start project implementation. \\nMethods for network scaling presented in the above-mentioned report [3] will make  it possible to accept more than 50 million users in the near future. \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n02 \\n\\n========3========\\n\\n2. The KIBO framework \\nCurrently, Ethereum infrastructure cannot yet offer a complete solution which in- cludes the decentralized part of the interface (the required functionality will appear  at the Metropolis stage. An excerpt from Ethereum’s offcial blog [5]: \\nAs it is not yet possible to decentralize the application interface itself at the mo- ment, the KIBO project is implemented partially in a server infrastructure which con- tains standard solutions for such cases, as well as a specialized application based  on smart contracts. In parallel with the work on the server solution, we are working  on various options for decentralizing the interface part, including our own solution. \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n03 \\n\\n========4========\\n\\n3. The contract scheme. \\nThe KIBO Ethereum infrastructure is a set of contracts which interact with each  other according to the scheme below: \\nAt the initial stages of the platform’s work, contracts in the system can be replaced  (by the voting of control tokens, which at this stage are in the team of KIBO devel- opers). Upon completion of the test and development stages, the relations between  contracts will be recorded and subsequent changes in contracts and their relation- ships will not be possible. \\nA. Managing contract \\nThe contract which coordinates the interaction of all other KIBO contracts, such  as lotteries or voting contracts. New user registration, lottery ticket purchases and  implementation of decisions adopted in a voting contract are performed by means  of referencing the managing contract. \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n04 \\n\\n========5========\\n\\nB. Repository \\n repository contract is used to store data about users, franchisee partners and their  relationships. It should be noted that the contract only stores anonymous data that  are not linked to the user’s identity (the user is defned by his/her alias and wallet),  so any system user can be completely anonymous. \\nModifcation of certain data in the repository is only possible from the managing  contract; the central contract address is determined by voting of control token hold- ers. \\nstruct K_Users_User { \\nuint shareholder; \\nuint big; \\nuint small; \\nuint partner_type; \\nstring username; \\nuint[8] partner_parents; \\nuint[8] partner_parents_level; \\nuint[8] player_parents; \\nuint[8] player_parents_level;    \\n} \\n// if user is shareholder  \\n// amount of kibits 2 user \\n// if user is partner \\n// 0 - new, 1 - registered before platform start // login \\n// parents-partners structure for 7 levels // user have %q% partners at level of 7 \\n// parents-players structure for 7 levels // user have %q% players at level of 7 \\nC. Voting contract \\nA contract that stores a list of issues for the management of all contracts, as well as  the conditions for making decisions on these issues. The voting and decision-mak- ing system is implemented such as to allow the development of the platform and  the addition of new games to KIBO’s functionality without the possibility of interven- tion in the algorithms for accrual and work with the customer base of the separate  branch of each partner. Only control token holders have the right to vote in this  contract. \\nstruct K_Ballot_Type { \\nstring theme; \\nuint quorum; \\nuint need; \\nuint length; \\n} \\n//  issue text \\n//  quorum for decision-making as a % //  % for decision-making //  voting duration (seconds) \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n05 \\n\\n========6========\\n\\n4. Contract management \\nContract management is carried out by voting of control token holders. The list of  issues and the decision-making conditions for each of them is initially set in the  contract. Any control token holder can initiate voting on any issue in the list and  vote.  Voting results are accepted in the case of a positive vote of 30\\xa0% to 51\\xa0% of  control token holders, depending on the importance and impact on the subsequent  development and operation of the KIBO platform of the issue put to vote. \\nTo further stimulate voting activity, the following mechanism has been implement- ed: accrual of remuneration per token upon voting is carried out immediately after a  control token holder votes. The amount of remuneration for all 10,000 tokens is 1\\xa0%  of turnover from all platform lotteries. \\nWhen tickets are purchased, funds are distributed as follows \\nBranch bonus: 17% \\nPayout on KIBITS: 14% \\nLottery prize fund: 68% \\nPayout on control tokens: 1% \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n06 \\n\\n========7========\\n\\nPayout for the KIBO  PLATFORM franchisee  \\nbranch network \\n10\\xa0% \\nFor payout of bonus- es for the line-by-line  branch network. 7\\xa0%  distributed upwards,  \\n1\\xa0% per level. \\nPayout on KIBIT  \\ntokens  \\n14\\xa0% \\nDeferred payout on  \\ncontrol tokens \\n1\\xa0% \\nPrize fund formation  \\n68 % \\n5. Tokens \\nThe KIBO platform has several different types of tokens, each of which has its own  set of features and an expanded incentive system. All Payouts and accruals of re- muneration in the branch network and all types of tokens are triggered when tickets  are purchased (this is the most frequent action in the system). Payouts of prizes to  players are also triggered by this and in one more way described below in the “Pay- out” section. All platform tokens are not KIBO internal currency and are not intended  for internal settlements in the system. All payouts and remunerations are made  directly to the user’s wallet in ETH cryptocurrency. \\nKIBO control token  10,000 units are intended for contract management. It allows  one to put issues to a vote (voting contract) or vote on an issue. To further stimulate  voting activity, 1\\xa0% (in ETH cryptocurrency) from the total turnover of all lotteries  connected to the KIBO system is accrued to all 10,000 tokens. Accrual of remu- neration takes place at all times; however, the actual payout to the user’s wallet is  carried out only at the moment a control token holder votes. Thus, we strengthen  the motivation to vote, even for minority holders of control tokens. \\nAt the initial stage, control tokens will be distributed among the managing partners.  In the future, all or part of the control tokens may be distributed among a large num- ber of partners interested in the project’s development and growth. These are major  holders of KIBIT tokens or owners of platforms with large client bases. \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n07 \\n\\n========8========\\n\\nThis mechanism is incorporated in the smart contract algorithm in order to transfer  contract management to a decentralized basis in the future. \\nKIBIT token:  The KIBO platform’s main investment asset. There are a total of 350  million tokens, to which 14\\xa0% of total turnover from all platform lotteries is accrued.  \\nAs part of the marketing strategy, at the crowd-sale stage 100 million KIBIT tokens  will be distributed, to which 4\\xa0% of turnover will be allocated. The remaining 250 mil- lion are owned by the development team and will form the company’s income and  will be used at the team’s discretion, including for further platform development,  options within the team, and other strategic decisions.  \\nTokens not sold during the sale remain under the control of the managing partners.  Income generated by these tokens may be \\nsent to a specifc address by voting. \\nKIBO PLATFORM token:  Allows one to become a KIBO branch owner and receive  the  respective  bonus  for  the  expansion  of  the  client  network  and  building  of  a  branch  network.  All  operations  and  payouts  of  remuneration  in  the  operation  of  KIBO branches are guaranteed by a smart contract. There a total of 20,000 base  (Kibo Platform) tokens \\nThe branch owner receives 10\\xa0% from all tickets purchased by clients invited by him  5 levels deep \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n08 \\n\\n========9========\\n\\nAlso,  the  KIBO  platform’s  functionality  incorporates  the  possibility  of  expanding  one’s own branch network by sending registration links and platform recommen- dations  at  the  time  of  the  crowdsale.  When  there  are  such  networks,  additional  accruals from each of these platforms will be 10\\xa0% from the income of all partner  branches up to the 7th level. \\nThus, 17\\xa0% will be paid out from the purchase of each ticket to stimulate the devel- opment of the client network and branch network. 10\\xa0% from ticket sales is paid out  to the client base owner, and 7\\xa0% is allocated among 7 levels upwards, 1\\xa0% each, for  payout to higher branches, which is equal to 10\\xa0% of the partner’s income at each  level.  \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n09 \\n\\n========10========\\n\\n6. Integrated marketing tool to promote continuous \\nplatform growth \\nThe user can participate in promotions and draws which are present on the KIBO  LOTTO platform. Any player can invite other players to the platform using his own  link and receive 5\\xa0% of the invited players’ winnings on a constant basis. This mech- anism is also managed by a smart contract and is part of a marketing strategy  called “game with friends”. Receipt of winnings from a game with friends is gov- erned by the following rules: \\nTo receive 5\\xa0% of the winnings of invited players:  \\nAt level 1 you must have bought 1 ticket for this draw  At level 2 you must have bought 3 tickets for this draw At level 3 you must have bought 7 tickets for this draw \\nThus, the player is interested in inviting other players, because \\nevery invited person will greatly increase the chances of winning in each draw.  \\nPromotion \\nAn important marketing component embedded in the KIBO platform smart con- tract is the proper motivation of each client at all levels of development, both for  ordinary users and for the platform owners.  \\nIn the promotional draws, which will continue for three months after the platform  launch, everyone can take part in a series of free draws with large cash prizes. This  promotion is aimed at expanding the client base of each branch and KIBO LOTTO  as a whole. Each player, as part of this promotion, will be able to give his friends the  opportunity to participate in this series of draws. The free tickets received by a play- er as a gift win only if 6 numbers are matched. As in the “Game with friends” mecha- nism, if a player at one of the three levels below another player wins, the latter player  receives 5\\xa0% of the amount won by the former player.  To obtain this bonus, it is not  necessary to buy tickets; the player needs only activate his free tickets for this draw.  \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n10 \\n\\n========11========\\n\\nFree ticket activation and protection against bots. \\nTo reduce the risk of possible bot attacks during free draws, free ticket activation  for a new player is carried out through balance refll in an amount of $1 or more.  After that, a restriction on cash withdrawal is set and funds in the amount of $1  cannot be withdrawn, but are at the user’s disposal. They are available for purchase  of tickets for participation in any paid draws that are held on the platform along with  the promotions. The user can withdraw any amount above $1 at any time. Once this  account has purchased 3 tickets on the platform, the restriction is automatically  removed, and from that point on the user can withdraw all the funds and zero out  the balance.  Thus, a bot attack becomes very costly and is comparable to simple  participation in the lottery, but for larger amounts. \\nPrize fund formation and distribution. \\n68\\xa0% of a ticket purchase is allocated to prize fund formation.  \\nComments:  Since we have tickets from which payouts for the partner and client  bonus do not come entirely, as they fall within the area of non-distribution, there is  always a remainder. This remainder is always used to replenish the current draw  prize fund. This means that in fact the percentage used for prize fund formation is  different each time and is always greater than 68\\xa0%. Let us take the initial 68\\xa0% as  the basis for the description. These funds are intended for payouts related to the  lottery and distributed according to the reserve funds system within the contract as  follows \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n11 \\n\\n========12========\\n\\n10% are deposited to the “reserve fund”, from which a guaranteed minimum jackpot  is formed for the next draw, if a jackpot is to be awarded in the current draw.   \\n13.5%  are used for the formation of a fund from which 5\\xa0% are paid three levels  upwards if a player with players above that invited him wins. Part of these funds will  not be spent each time after draw completion. For example, if a player who has only  one player above him wins. In this case, 10\\xa0% will not be paid to anyone. After each  draw, the unclaimed remainder from this fund is automatically sent to the “reserve  fund” of this lottery.  \\n76.5%  are used for the formation of the prize fund, from which the jackpot and oth - er prizes are formed. \\nNext, 2 of the 4 lotteries presented on the platform at launch are \\ndescribed as an example. \\nLottery 6/49 \\n76.5\\xa0% of funds received for the formation of the prize payout fund in the lottery  6/49 are allocated as follows. \\nFirst of all, 48\\xa0% goes towards jackpot formation. By directing the funds from a  purchased ticket to increase the jackpot frst of all, we always know the jackpot size  even before the draw and we can refect its increase in proportion with ticket sales.  Other prizes are formed after draw completion from the remaining 52\\xa0% as follows.   \\nFixed prizes are calculated frst  \\nTickets that guessed 2 main balls are frst. These players receive a prize in  an amount equal to the ticket price. \\nNext, those who guessed 2 main balls + bonus ball receive their payout. The  amount of the payout is 1.7 times the ticket price. \\nNext, those who guessed 3 main balls receive their payout. The amount of  the payout is 3 times the ticket price. \\nThe remaining funds are allocated among those who guessed 4 numbers or more  in the following order: \\n4 main balls 57\\xa0% \\n5 main balls + bonus ball 16\\xa0% 5 main balls 27\\xa0% \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n12 \\n\\n========13========\\n\\nFor example: 10 players guessed 5 balls; 27\\xa0% is allocated among them in equal  shares. \\nJackpot increase \\nIf in the current draw the jackpot is not won, the jackpot funds (48\\xa0%) go to increase  the next jackpot. That is, we take the 48\\xa0% and add them to the amount that is  allocated for the jackpot from the ticket sales for the next draw. Thus, the jackpot  continues to grow until it is won. Once the jackpot is won, the contract accesses  the reserve fund and withdraws the amount for the minimum guaranteed jackpot,  which increases from ticket sales according to the same scheme.  \\nGeneral points   \\nA lottery contract is intended for conducting a lottery and storage of its draw results. Only the last 8 draws + the current draw are stored. \\nTo generate random numbers, a combination of several factors is used: \\nEvery time a ticket is purchased, the user transmits a random set of data   (automatically generated by frontend by default) \\nAfter completion of the draw, the contract takes hashes of every other block  out of the 14 blocks after draw completion and mixes them with the ran- dom data from users. \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n13 \\n\\n========14========\\n\\n  // generate 7 numbers (6 + 1 bonus number)  \\n  function generateResult() private { \\n    if (game - 1 > 0) { \\n      uint counter = 1; \\n      uint tmp_num = 0; \\n      for (uint i = 0; i < 6; i++) { \\n        tmp_num = generateResultNum(game - 1, i, counter); \\n        while(!checkResult(tmp_num)) { \\n          tmp_num = generateResultNum(game - 1, i, counter); \\n          counter += 1; \\n        } \\n        result[game - 1][i] = tmp_num; \\n      } \\n      result[game - 1][6] = generateResultNum(game - 1, 7, counter); \\n    } \\n  } \\n  // ... \\n  // When drawing is ended, we remember the block.number \\n  // Then we wait 50 blocks; \\n  // Then using this remembered block we start to generate 7 numbers each second block back   // starting from remembered block + 30 \\n  // After all it is several blocks ahead from drawing end and several blocks behind current   function generateResultNum(uint _game, uint _index, uint _counter) constant private returns  (uint) { \\n    uint num = 0; \\n    uint last_block = game_stats[_game].gameendblock + 30; \\n    num = ((uint160(sha3(block.blockhash(last_block - _index * 2), user_random[_game] [uint160(sha3(block.blockhash(last_block - _index * 2))) % user_random[_game].length])) * _counter) %  49) + 1; \\n    return num; \\n  } \\nJokerBall lottery \\nIn the JokerBall lottery, unlike in 6/49, the winning combination takes into account  not only the digit, but also its position in the number. The JACKPOT is fxed and is  allocated among the winners in the following way: \\nCoincidence \\nPrize \\n2 \\n0.0003 % of the Jackpot per one ticket \\n3 \\n0.0006 % of the Jackpot per one ticket \\n4 \\n0.005 % of the Jackpot per one ticket \\n5 \\n0.05% of the Jackpot per one ticket \\n6 \\n2 % of the Jackpot per one ticket, but not more \\nthan 100 % \\n7 \\n100 % of the Jackpot on all tickets \\nRandom number generation is similar to that for lottery 6/49. The lottery scheme is  also identical to that for lottery 6/49 \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n14 \\n\\n========15========\\n\\n7. Payout of winnings \\nDue to the technical limitations of the ETHEREUM network at the moment, payouts  of winnings are made at the user’s request (a click on the button in the user inter- face next to the corresponding draw). \\nDue to the fact that in order to make the payout, a large number of records in the  contract must be sorted (since payouts on some matches are made as a percent- age, that is, they depend on the number of people who guessed the given combina- tion), the payout is not made immediately, but only after sorting all the necessary  data. \\nFor one user’s payout request, 100 tickets are sorted; after all the tickets have been  sorted,  the actual payout to all users is launched by clicking the “payout” button  (100 payouts per click). Payouts are made only to those users who have clicked the  “payout” button.  \\nThus, in order to complete sorting and payouts on all the tickets, one out of ffty  users who purchased a ticket needs to take his winnings. As the Ethereum network  scales up, the number of tickets sorted in a single operation will increase. \\nKIBO Whitepaper \\n15 \\n\\n========16========\\n\\n8. Conclusion \\nThis document presents a part of the technological and marketing solutions that  are planned in the process of the KIBO platform’s development. Also, as the Ethe- reum blockchain improves, we will actively use emerging network capabilities that  will make KIBO the most reliable and extensive decentralized lottery in the world,  and will provide an opportunity to all those who joined the platform at the starting  period to share our success.  \\n9.

Building  upon  the  well-established  business  model  of  shared  workspaces,  the  Primalbase  project  transforms  traditional  office  rental  into  a  new-generation  community-based ecosystem where one can share, sell or  rent  out  high-quality  office  spaces  using  Ethereum  and  Waves-based  digital  tokens. Primalbase  tokens  not  only  serve  a  practical  function,  but  also  have  actual  inherent  value based on a real physical product: it is this that makes  Primalbase stand out from other projects utilizing crypto  tokens. The conception of the project and its core elements  are outlined in this paper. \\n1. Introduction \\nReal  estate  is  one  of  the  most  conservative  areas  of  the  economy,  while  Blockchain  is  considered  a  disruptive  and  novel  technology.  Nevertheless,  combining these seemingly incompatible elements has proved extremely fruitful  — a salient example being WeWork.  \\nThe foundation of most co-working projects is the concept of creating a shared  infrastructure with a global community. The advantages of this business model  over  the  management  practices  of  large  corporations,  with  their  rigid  internal  regulations  and  strict  hierarchy,  are  quite  apparent.  This  is  especially  true  for  young  technological  start-ups,  who  are  increasingly  rejecting  the  traditional  office set up in favour of co-working environments. This format has gained much  traction:  according  to  2017  Global  Coworking  Survey,  the  number  of  new  coworking  projects  has  roughly  doubled  since  2011,  and  the  number  of  their  residents is estimated at 1.2 million (see also fig. 1). \\n\\n========1========\\n\\nFig. 1: Basic coworking spaces statistics, from Global Coworking survey 2017 \\nThe number of successful co-working projects – most notably WeWork, Spaces  and Second Home – evidences the vitality and potential of this business model.  According to [1], «… the creative hub is more than the sum of its parts. It offers  creative micro businesses the chance to aggregate with others in order to access  crucial resources such as tools, specialist services, or inspiration to help develop  projects  and  businesses.  Hubs  represent  a  collective  approach  to  coping  with  uncertain social, cultural and economic environments and processes of creativity  and  innovation  …  Our  research  shows  that  creative  hubs  can  produce  a  wide  range  of  impacts  including  start-up  ventures,  jobs,  new  products  and  services,  future  investment  (public  and  commercial),  talent  development,  regional  talent  retention,  informal  education  and  engagement,  training,  urban  regeneration,  research  and  development,  new  networks,  innovative  models  of  organization,  quality of life enhancements and resilience». \\nWe  believe  that  the  use  of  crypto-tokens will  both  benefit  and  enhance  this  model: it was this notion that inspired the creation of this project. Through the  use of a single-payment crypto-token membership, the Primalbase project offers  access  to  all-inclusive  shared  workspaces  located  in  the  world’s  leading  tech  hubs. It’s scalable, fast to set up, and flexible in terms of timing and the size of  the team. \\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The first section will outline the  basic  concept  of  the  project  and  summarize  its  core  components.  The  second  section  is  devoted  to  explaining  the  token  system:  their  purpose,  the  pricing  mechanism and the transfer of ownership. The rules of the initial coin offering  (ICO)  campaign  will  also  be  charted  in  this  section.  The  legal  aspects  and  limitations  associated  with  this  project  will  be  discussed  in  the  final  sections.  Appendix  A  provides  a  summary  of  the  stack  of  Blockchain  technologies  that  will play a key role in the operation of the project. The accompanying software  architecture is schematically described in Appendix B. \\n\\n========2========\\n\\n2. Concept \\nThe  project  will  be  executed  in  two  main  stages.  The  first  stage  is  the  establishment  of  five  shared  workspaces  in  the  following  strategic  locations:  Amsterdam, Berlin, London, New York and Singapore. Strategic in that, each is  regarded as one of the most beneficial cities for tech entrepreneurs. These spaces  will  be  up  to  2000  square  meters  in  size.  The  locations  of  future  Primalbase  workspaces will be decided by the vote of the Primalbase token holders (see also  paragraph 2.2). \\nA  system  of  dividing  the  infrastructure  into  rentable  offices  (based  on  classic,  standard real estate relations) and non-rentable co-working spaces reserved only  for Primalbase community members (based on crypto-economic relations), will  ensure efficiency and profitability of Primalbase business model. Non-members  can obtain temporary membership and access to co-working spaces through the  renting of tokens from Primalbase community members. \\nAlthough  ultimately,  the  underlying  profit  of  Primalbase  will  be  made  through  the renting of office space to companies, project teams, startups, branch offices,  etc. This will cover the operating expenses of the property management company. \\nThe cryptocurrency token Primalbase (PBT) is built on the WAVES platform and  is  compatible  with  Ethereum  protocols  (cf.  appendix  B).  There  is  a  proof-of- concept up and running in Amsterdam, which is already receiving endorsements  from prominent international tech entrepreneurs who have become members of  Primalbase\\'s  growing  community.  In  accordance  with  the  business  model  outlined  above,  the  Amsterdam  unit  provides  shared  workspaces  to  the  current  members of the Primalbase community. \\nTo  develop  and  run  more  Primalbase  units  we  need  to  collect  funds  that  will  cover  start-up  costs,  the  operating  expenses  of  the  Property  Management  Company,  as  well  as  capital  expenditures  (building  the  offices  with  shared  workspaces in selected locations). To accomplish this task, the ICO procedure is  necessary.  \\nThe  funds  collected  through  ICO  will  allow  us to  begin  the  creation  of  Primalbase infrastructures, adjust the first five units to the level of cost recovery,  and  ultimately  produce  the  revenue  to  be  re-invested  in  building  the  next  locations. The value of the tokens will surge as the demand continues to rise. \\nAdditionally,  the  tokenization  of  our  shared  workspaces  provides  us  with  a  unique  opportunity  to  establish  a  pool  of  committed  community  members,  tenants, landlords and opinion leaders, who we can rely on in the future stages of  the project’s development.  \\n\\n========3========\\n\\n3. Token system 3.1 Purpose and functionality \\nThere are 3 main reasons for adopting the token system: \\n§ \\n§ \\n§ \\nIt  is  a  means  of  raising  enough  money  to  develop  the  project.  Well- implemented  crowd  sales,  with  carefully  defined  objectives  and  guarantees, are one the best ways to both generate capital and to build a  community that has a stake in its success. \\nThe token represents a simple universal measure of the value of renting  membership from community members, the rising number of Primalbase  locations,  efficiency  of  the  shared  workspaces  model,  and  operating  profitability of the company. \\nThe  tokens  can  be  considered  as  an  investment  instrument  because  its  market value can significantly change as the project develops. \\nTo expand on that last point — opening hubs in new locations should lead to an  increase in our community membership, which in turn will allow us to establish  and secure new partnership agreements. The operating profit will also grow, as its  source is not the turnover of the tokens themselves, but the classical real estate  business model of subletting office space. This financial flow will enable us to  open several new hubs, which will lead to a further increase in the price of the  tokens — if only because each token will give access to an ever-increasing office  infrastructure. This process is depicted schematically on the figure below. \\nFig. 2: Diagram of token market price mechanics \\nWe emphasize that the Primalbase team cannot guarantee a monotonic increase in  the price of tokens and is not responsible for the possible losses associated with  such  speculative  use  of  tokens.  Access  to  all  Primalbase  hubs  services  and  functionality is guaranteed unconditionally on the current market price of a token. \\n\\n========4========\\n\\n3.2 Token specification \\nOne  PBT  token  allows  full  access  to  the  shared  workspace  at  any  Primalbase  location  for  one  person.  In  every  office  space,  all  the  necessary  services  and  amenities will be present and provided, such as broadband Internet access, digital  printing, etc. The term of the token is unlimited and, therefore, does not expire.  The fee itself is secured in a single payment. The number of tokens that can be  purchased  by  the  same  holder  is  unlimited.  In  this  case,  the  possession  of  4  tokens permits the use of a private office, if one is available.  \\nAs noted above, current tokens holders can participate in the further development  of the project: for example, to participate in the selection of future sites for new Primalbases, as decided by a general vote. Tokens are not bound to a person or  company, and anyone who can certify their ownership of it can use it. That is, the  token can be resold or leased on (see paragraph 2.3). \\nPBT  tokens  are  divisible,  i.e.  their  number  need  not  be  an  integer.  Fractional  shares  are  introduced  for  the  convenience  of  working  with  PBT  as  investment  assets. The smallest fraction is 0.0001 PBT. It is worth noting that to access the  services of the hub the holder must have at least one complete token. \\nWe  assume  that  all  participants  in  the  project  will  maintain  a  proper  level  of  decorum, decency and ethical conduct. Therefore, the team reserves the right to  revoke  membership,  and  deny  access  to  Primalbase hubs  for  gross  or  repeated  violation of the rules of conduct. In this case, the current holder of the tokens can  only sell them. \\nThe  total  number  of  free-to-use  tokens  is  limited  to  1000.  Another  250  tokens  will be held in store for the social activities of the tech community, and will be at  the disposal of members of the advisory board.  \\nDuring the ICO, the payment can be made in any currency, both fiat and crypto;  in the case of the latter, it will be possible to use third party conversion services  like Kraken or Shapeshift. On the first day of ICO price of PBT will be equal to 3  Bitcoins (BTC), and from the second to the seventh day of ICO — to 4 BTC.  Starting from the eighth day the cost of the token will be 5 BTC.  \\nThe  funds  raised  during  ICO  stage  will  be  kept  in  a  multi-signature  wallet  supervised by three members of the Advisory board. Funds are transparent and  will  be  spent  according  to  the  long-term  strategic  plan  (see  also  sec.  4);  an  approximate breakdown of raised funds is depicted on fig. 3 below.  \\nThe ICO campaign will take place until the purchase of all 1000 tokens, but for  no longer than 1 month. If, not all the tokens are sold by the end of this period,  the unrealized balance will also be placed at the disposal of the board of directors.  Operations with tokens (sale, leasing, etc.) will be allowed only after the end of  the ICO campaign. \\n\\n========5========\\n\\nFig. 3: Approximate breakdown of funds spending \\nAs the project develops, part of the operating profit is expected to be spent on the  purchase  of  a  certain  number  of  tokens.  This  will  allow  the  reinvestment  of  revenue into the further development of the project — specifically, the opening of  new  hubs.  Moreover,  these  measures  will  partly  help  preserve  the  liquidity  of  PBT tokens at a level sufficient to make them an attractive investment medium. \\n3.3 Token ownership  \\nPrimalbase members  can  rent  or  sell  their  tokens  using  the  special  technical  feature of the underlying WAVES protocols. From a technical point of view, this  means that ownership of any amount of PBT can be transferred, temporarily or  permanently. These are peer-to-peer transactions; therefore, parties must agree on  costs and payments between themselves. \\nThe holder of the token is protected by his own Blockchain — the protocol works  in such a way that the token cannot be transferred on but remains in the wallet of  the rentee: in effect, the token is on a «temporary loan». The minimal duration  that a token can be rented is 3 months, and there is no maximum period. A rental  agreement may be terminated ahead of time by mutual decision of the parties or  unilaterally.  Formally,  the  WAVES  platform  does  not  allow  the  inclusion  of  specific leasing rules (i.e. the price, time, conditions, etc.) into the Blockchain, as  there can be too many scenarios of interaction between users. However, within  the leasing agreement between the parties, there are guarantees on the fulfillment  of contractual obligations of all involved. \\nA token holder can sell as many tokens as they choose. However, any holder who  has  sold  all  their  tokens,  loses  the  right  to  access  the  co-working  services  provided. The innate features of Blockchain technologies make it impossible to  restore the ownership of tokens if the holder has, for whatever reason, lost his  private key. The responsibility to reliably store the private key is that of the token  holder alone.  \\n\\n========6========\\n\\n4. Legal aspects and issues \\nDue  to  the  retrospective  nature  of  regulatory  action,  our  team  can  make  no  guarantees regarding the legality of the platform or launch of ICO campaign in  any given jurisdiction. PBT tokens are not securities and do not hold any rights in  the  company.  We  must  operate  our  business  in  accordance  with  the  laws  of  relevant jurisdictions. As such, PBT tokens may not be immediately available in  certain countries. \\nThe advisory board protects investors’ interests and provides the latter with all  the necessary reportage. The investor relations are built in a way like that of IPO  — based on quarterly investment reports. \\nAll legal aspects of real estate transactions — including, but not limited to, the  management and negotiation of rental contracts, the maintenance and surveillance  of buildings, and tax payments — will be coordinated by a central management  unit in the UK. \\n5. Future development \\nWe intend to create larger scale and all-encompassing hubs at the most suitable  locations.  Developing  on  our  original  Primalbase  concept,  we  will  create  more  extensive  all-inclusive  venues  with  bars,  restaurants,  event  spaces  and  other  related facilities. A part of the profit made from these ventures will be distributed  among token holders. \\nBased  on  business  tasks  and  received  feedback,  we  can  enhance  token  functionality  and  add  new  features.  The  modular  structure  of  chosen  digital  platform allows for further development and extension. \\n\\n========7========\\n\\nAppendix A. Blockchain technologies \\nLedgers have been at the heart of commerce since ancient times and are used to  record  many  things,  most  commonly  assets  such  as  money  and  property.  Blockchain technology relies on the concept of distributed digital ledgers, which  are  essentially  asset  databases  that  can  be  shared  across  a  network  of  multiple  sites or institutions. All participants within a network can have their own identical  copy of the ledger. Any changes to the ledger are reflected in all copies within  minutes, or in some cases, seconds. \\nDistributed  ledgers  are  inherently  harder  to  attack,  compared  to  traditional  centralized versions. Instead of a single database, there are multiple shared copies  of  the  same  database,  so  a  cyber-attack  would  have  to  attack  all  the  copies  simultaneously to be successful. The technology is also resistant to unauthorized  change or malicious tampering, as participants in the network would immediately  spot  a  change  to  any  part  of  the  ledger.  Furthermore,  the  method  by  which  information is secured and updated means that participants can share data and be  confident that all copies of the ledger at any one-time match each other. \\nTraditional ledgers achieve a level of privacy by limiting information access to  the parties involved and a trusted third party. By contrast, a Blockchain system is  transparent: all network participants can examine records in the ledger. Privacy  can still be maintained, however, by breaking the flow of information in another place  — keeping  pseudonymous  public  keys,  which  correspond  to  the  participants.  The  network  can  see  that  a  transaction  occurred,  but  uninvolved  parties lack the information to link the transaction with specific identities. \\nIn 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin [2], the first implementation of a  protocol that enables the issuance of a digital bearer instrument without a trusted  third party. This was achieved through the use of the ledger replication system  i.e.  Blockchain.  Bitcoin  solves  the  difficult  problem  of  implementing  decentralized  digital  cash,  but  its  security  model  limits  its  efficiency  and  throughput: its design only supports a single native asset, and its virtual machine  offers  limited  support  to  custom  programs  that  determine  asset  movement,  sometimes called smart contracts. \\nEthereum,  which  launched  in  2015,  develops  the  concept  of  a  Blockchain  to  a  fully programmable state replication mechanism. While it includes a much more  powerful programming language, it presents additional challenges for scalability  and  efficiency.  Its  general-purpose  computation  model  makes  it  difficult  for  engineers to reason about security of their applications. \\nFor  further  information  interested  readers  are  referred  to  surveys  [3,  4]  and  monographs [5-8]. \\n\\n========8========\\n\\nAppendix B. Application architecture \\nFig. 4: Schematics of Primalbase applications infrastructure \\nWAVES  protocols  and  routines  constitute  the  core  of  Primalbase digital  infrastructure and functionality. The advantages of using WAVES platform are:  ease  of  custom  token  creation,  low  cost  of  operations,  built-in  decentralized  exchange, and integrated work with fiat currencies. Most of the operations can be  performed without leaving the WAVES wallet. WAVES platform is compatible  and interoperable with Ethereum platform, as Ethereum is the renowned market  leader  and  popularly  used  in  crowd  sales.  We  believe  that  in  the  future  all  the  Blockchain systems will be combined into one ecosystem; therefore, the WAVES  platform was chosen as the key element of Primalbase apps. WAVES is making  great  strides  towards  this  goal,  which  will,  naturally,  increase  accessibility  and  create new opportunities.  \\n\\n========9========\\n\\nReferences \\n[1] Creative Hubs: Understanding the New Economy.

Because botting is cheap and hard to detect, it may even be economically rational for downstream  entities to knowingly serve ads to bots. \\nAd buyers are increasingly frustrated by having their money stolen.3 While programmatic ad buying is  undoubtedly the path forward for quantifying the value of ad buys relative to direct dealing and is the  highest growth area of digital advertising, programmatic is, at present, a morass for quantifying efficacy in  advertising non-installable goods.4 The behaviors of humans on web pages are easily mimicked by bots  and the flagging of bot network signatures is essentially a cat and mouse game.5 This leaves advertisers  mostly powerless against the incentive structure of the downstream supply chain. \\nThe adChain  R egistry  i s a decentrally-owned domain  w hitelist being  l aunched as  a  c ollaboration  of  ConsenSys,  M etaX,  an d  D ata & Marketing  A ssociation  ( DMA),  a n  i ndustry group with  1, 400 active  members  a nd over  100, 000 participants.  a dToken  h olders play  a n  i ncentivized voting  g ame  t o determine whether  a n applicant  t o the  r egistry  i s  a  l egitimate  a nd reputable  publ isher  o r  no t. Token holders  r ealize no upside  f or the volume  of  i mpressions  s erved to publishers  i n  t he  r egistry; rather, they realize upside by seeing  t he  num ber  of  publ ishers  a pplying  t o and renewing  l istings  i n the  r egistry  i ncrease. So long  a s  t he registry is kept clean of bot traffic, advertisers will want to service bid requests from its registrants. So long as advertisers desire  t o service  b id  re quests from  re gistrants,  re gistrants will  d esire  t o  re new their listings and unlisted publishers will desire  t o apply for  l istings.  T oken  h olders are incentivized to keep fraudulent applicants out of the registry by voting  ju diciously  to maintain  th is  v irtuous  c ycle. \\nThe adChain Registry \\nThe adChain Registry is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain which stores domain names  accredited as non-fraudulent by adToken holders. The presence of the domain foo.net in the registry  means that adToken holders have recently assessed that domain belongs to a legitimate publisher with a  real human audience. \\nThe Registry also exposes both an interface with which token holders propose new domains to be listed,  and one to challenge such proposals. An interface for token holders to vote on outcomes when challenges  are raised is also exposed. \\n1 \\n“Ad Fraud Estimates Double”. WPP. Business Insider.

June 8, 2016. \\npg. 2  \\n\\n========2========\\n\\nFinally, an interface is exposed with which adToken holders can vote to reparameterize constant factors in  the Registry, such as the period over which listing applications are challengeable. \\nListing Applications and Data \\nTo apply for listing in the adChain Registry, the applicant supplies a domain name such as foo.net and an  adToken deposit. The application sits in an application pool for the duration of a challenge period. If no  challenges are raised against the application over the course of the challenge period, the domain is added  to the Registry. \\nListings in the adChain Registry are only valid for a finite period of time. Because domain names can be  sold or degrade in quality over time, a high quality domain today may be low quality tomorrow.  Registrants can apply to renew a listing prior to the lapse of its accreditation, and a successful renewal will  cause no interruption to the domain’s accreditation status. When a listing’s accreditation lapses, the  adToken deposit made with the original listing application can be withdrawn by the applicant. \\nListings may include additional, optional metadata such as whether the registrant accepts BAT6 payments or an attestation of compliance with tintr standards.  \\nChallenging Applications For Listing \\nApplications for apparently fraudulent or low quality domains will be challenged by rational adToken  holders. To initiate a challenge against a listing application during its challenge period, a token holder  must deposit a sum of adToken equal to the deposit made by the applicant. Doing so initiates a voting  period during which token holders engage in a token-weighted vote which determines whether an  applicant is to be admitted. The voting scheme is commit-reveal and derives from Colony’s partial-lock  token weighted voting system.  \\n6 \\n “ Basic Attention Token (BAT)”. Brave Software. May 23, 2017. \\npg. 3  \\n\\n========3========\\n\\nIf the challenge is settled in favor of the applicant, the challenger’s deposit is forfeited and the applicant’s  domain is listed in the adChain Registry. If the challenge is settled in favor of the challenger, the  applicant’s deposit is forfeited and the applicant’s domain is not listed in the adChain Registry. Applicants  can reapply for listing as often as they like if their application fails. \\nWhen the vote concludes a percentage of the forfeited deposit is awarded directly to the winning party in  the challenge (either the applicant or the challenger) as a special dispensation. The remainder of the  deposit is divided proportionally among token voters in the winning bloc by token weight. Voters in the  losing bloc receive nothing.  \\nThe deposit of the winning party in the challenge is always returned to them. Tokens locked for voting are  always returned to their owners regardless of whether they were cast with the majority or the minority.  Only the deposit of the losing party in the challenge is redistributed and not recoverable by its original  owner. \\nParameterization of the Registry \\nThere are no constant (“magic number”) values in the adChain Registry. The Registry will be instantiated  with reasonable values based on the best estimations of the creators, but all of these will be changeable by  adToken holders who may vote to reparameterize the Registry. Parameterized values mentioned so far  include: application deposit amounts, the duration of the challenge period, the duration of a registration’s  validity, the duration of the commit and reveal periods in token votes and the size of the special  dispensation made to the winning party in token votes. Parameters of the governance system itself may be  votable as well, such as the share of tokens required to initiate a reparameterization. \\nAs an example of how the parameterization of constant values in the registry affects the mechanics of the  game, consider the special dispensation awarded to challenge winners. Rational actors should only  \\npg. 4  \\n\\n========4========\\n\\nchallenge listing applications based on a calculation of potential earnings, which is a function of the  challenger’s expected payout and confidence in winning the token vote. The challenger stands to lose  100% of their deposit if they lose the token vote, or win some amount over their original deposit if they  win the token vote. If the special dispensation is set at 50%, a rational challenger must be above 66%  confident in their ability to win a token vote to raise a challenge.7 Thus the percentage of the applicant’s  deposit allocated as a special dispensation for the challenger determines the confidence level above which  a rational challenger will submit challenges. \\nThe adToken supply is non-votable, and adToken can be neither minted nor destroyed. The  1,000,000,000 adToken deployed upon instantiation will be the set number of adToken in perpetuity. \\nThe Virtuous Incentive Structure Between Advertisers, Publishers and adToken Holders \\nMost payments  in  digital advertising  o ccur on  a  CPM basis. The CPM model creates misaligned  incentives  a nd  is  th e  s ource  o f many  is sues in the digital advertising supply chain. n advertiser pays a  publisher some fixed amount per thousand impressions and this constitutes a CPM. The problem with  the CPM model is that  i mpressions are an exceptionally weak  i ndicator of actual attention spending by  viewers. This is in part due to the fact that impressions are highly abstract notions which different  vendors assess in different ways. Vendors downstream from the advertiser are incentivized to assess what  constitutes an impression as loosely as possible.  \\nA malicious publisher in the advertiser to publisher example has no real incentive to report any page view  as less than a full impression. Indeed, because it is so easy for bots to impersonate human behavior on web  pages, it is often economically rational for a publisher to buy bot impressions and report them to the  advertiser as legitimate. The advertiser is incentivized to scrutinize the impression data they receive  carefully, but the task is essentially non-computable and devolves to statistical guessing. This problem is  exacerbated by the large number of intermediaries in a typical programmatic supply chain. A single ad  impression can transact between dozens of parties that sit between the advertiser and the publisher. The incentive structure of the publisher is identical to all those parties downstream of the advertiser, since  anybody who reports fraud down the line forfeits revenue for themselves by doing so. \\nThe key innovation of the adChain Registry is that it incentivizes the curation of a reputable supply pool  by decoupling the incentives of the registry owners (adToken holders) from CPMs. Token holders have  one concern, which is to flag fraudulent and low quality applicants to the pool and win votes to reject  those applications. The simple schelling point for these votes is around whether the applicant is fraudulent  or low-quality; voters acting rationally should settle in blocs for or against acceptance on the basis of their  assessment of those qualities. Voters who act rationally and perform good diligence will be rewarded. Less  diligent voters on the losing side incur opportunity cost without upside for having locked their adToken  uselessly over the duration of the voting period. \\nA final point must be understood to close the loop on the virtuous incentive cycle between advertisers,  publishers and token holders. A “meta” schelling point for voting behavior in challenges is not explicitly  whether the applicant is fraudulent or not, but what outcome in the vote will increase the value of  \\n7 \\nThere is a 33% chance of -100% deposit and a 66% chance of +50% deposit. (0.33)(-1) + (0.66)(.5) = 0. \\npg. 5  \\n\\n========5========\\n\\nadToken. While this notion should be very tightly coupled to the notion of fraudulence, it is useful to  consider it in its own right. \\nConsider that the challenge game is only available to play when there are applicants in the applicant pool.  The applicant pool will only have applicants in it while publishers desire to make or renew listings in the  adChain Registry. Publishers will only desire to make or renew listings in the adChain Registry while  advertisers desire to service bid requests for ad space from publishers in that registry. Advertisers, in turn,  will only desire to service bid requests for ad space from publishers in the adChain Registry while the  Registry is considered clean relative to other ad networks and whitelists. This being the case, token holders  are incentivized to keep the registry clean by initiating challenges against suspect applicants and voting to  remove apparently fraudulent listings. \\nThe game design of the adChain Registry, with its deposits and voting, has a lot in common with proof- of-stake consensus in blockchains. The key difference is that blockchains verify blocks, which is  computable, while adChain verifies domains as non-fraudulent, which is not. adChain thus explores the  general pattern of using collateralized consensus mechanisms to establish single sources of truth in non- computable domains. adChain does not aim to solve advertising fraud directly, it simply allows the  advertising industry to agree on what fraud is, and where to draw the line.  \\nPractical Utilization of the Registry \\nThe adChain Registry provides a high-quality, zero-cost whitelist from which advertisers can read to  assess whether or not to service inbound bid requests on ad opportunities. The minimal contents of a  listing in the adChain Registry, however, are nothing more than a domain name and an indicator of the  listing’s accreditation status. Assuming the absence of any authentication scheme, if foo.net is an  accredited registrant in the adChain Registry a bot farm could trivially impersonate foo.net by simply  changing the origin headers of their bid request messages. \\nAdvertisers need to protect themselves from the trivial attack in which bot farms impersonate adChain  registrants by spoofing origin headers. While the Registry itself is unopinionated on this matter, it will be  useful for the industry to settle on a uniform way of authenticating themselves to one another. The use of  bidirectional authentication using Transport Layer Security (TLS), a widely deployed and battle-tested  suite of technologies, can address this. The unidirectional handshake protocols of TLS underpin  authentication for HTTPS connections on the Web. Bidirectional TLS handshakes underpin  authentication in the widely used SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. \\nThis section  a lso discusses  t ools  w hich  w ill  be  pr ovided by MetaX to  enable token  h olders  t o easily  interact with  th e  a dChain  R egistry, and  a  p artnership  w ith  D ata &  M arketing  A ssociation, an  industry group with  1, 400  a ctive  m embers  a nd over 100,000 participants  w hich has  agr eed  t o  help move the project  forward with  th e  e xisting  in dustry.  \\npg. 6  \\n\\n========6========\\n\\nMutual Authentication Using TLS \\nBy pushing authentication out of the application layer and into a widely used transport layer technology  like TLS, adChain registrants can conduct ad commerce in RTB, VAST, VPAID or any other markup  format including ones which do not exist yet. It also means existing production-ready software can be  leveraged to perform the authentication, and onboarding costs for new users become as low as a few lines  in a webserver config file. \\nBidirectional TLS authentication using certificate signing keys in the Web HTTPS regime will suffice to  authenticate users in adChain. An advertiser servicing a bid request with headers indicating an origin at  foo.net will ask the sender to mutually authenticate in the TLS handshake. The recipient will expect  authentication to be performed with a key authenticable using an SSL certificate for foo.net issued by a  trusted Certificate Authority. \\nThe advertiser’s server implements the following branching logic: \\n1. Can this client perform mutual authentication over TLS? 2. If yes, did the client authenticate properly in the TLS handshake? 3. If yes, does this domain have a listing in the adChain Registry? \\nIf the answer to any of those questions is “no”, the server branches off to execute arbitrary logic to handle  that case. Supporting the authentication of adChain members does not mean advertisers must forgo  business with non-adChain members. \\nOn the supply side, entities serving bid requests must be able to authenticate in TLS sessions using the  certificate signing key of the registrant whose domain listing they solicit bids for. Technically savvy  publishers may choose to simply run their own ad servers to retain control of their certificate signing keys.  Most publishers, however, are used to working with vendors who solicit bids and return ad markup  without requiring they do anything more than embed Javascript on their webpage. Adopting mutual  authentication means vendors must either apply for a listing in the adChain Registry or interface with  publisher-controlled signing servers. \\nRational token voters should be biased towards rejecting vendor applications because vendors aggregating  supply from multiple publishers are difficult to audit and can easily hide bot traffic amongst their  legitimate traffic. The signing server approach is likely a happy middle-ground: deploying a signing server  should not be difficult even for relatively unsophisticated publishers who desire to retain control of their  certificate signing keys, and the task can be entrusted to specialized service providers as well. \\nAnother possibility is for publishers to simply entrust their certificate signing keys to proxies who work on  their behalf. Sharing a certificate signing key requires high trust in the proxy, but sophisticated vendors  may be able to build businesses using this model. \\npg. 7  \\n\\n========7========\\n\\nInterfaces for Voting \\nWhile the adChain Registry will be a smart contract on the public Ethereum blockchain available for  anybody’s equal use, MetaX intends to provide a user interface wrapping the Registry such that token  holders can participate in the voting process through a web browser. This interface will enable token  holders to apply for listings, open challenges, vote in challenges and vote on the parameterization of the  Registry itself. While this interface will be optional, it should make participation accessible to a much  larger audience. \\nBecause of the nature of smart contracts on public blockchains, anybody will be able to write their own  GUI wrappers should they so choose. Interaction with the Registry through tools like MetaMask,  MyEtherWallet, Mist or a command line will obviously work as well. \\nPartnership with Data &  Marketing  A ssociation  \\n“It’s inspiring  t o  se e smart start-ups take on providing innovative solutions to challenges in our  industry that  a re resulting in  f raud and injuring  m arketers’  r elationships  w ith  t heir  c ustomers.

Brave, Gnosis, Golem, Melonport, SingularDTV and the like  are creating blockchain platforms to rival existing platforms but are designed to grow from the bottom-up,  which certainly is a valid approach. The design of adChain was motivated from the outset by the  challenge of onboarding the existing advertising technology industry. The complexity of this platform is  not entirely captured in the protocol itself, but in the interaction between the protocol and existing  industry players. The protocol is intentionally simple for this reason; if the system were too complex it  would be too difficult for industry players to determine their place within it and optimal strategies, which  would slow adoption. \\npg. 8  \\n\\n========8========\\n\\nThis  pr oject’s  g overnance  w ill likely  b e  a  p ivotal factor  in  its long-term  s uccess.

The platform itself has been  th rough  m ultiple  ite rations and  r edesigns  o ver  th e  p ast six  m onths  a fter  r eceiving  fe edback from  c ommunity  m embers, industry participants and legal advisors. Over the past year, ConsenSys and MetaX decided to pre-sell 10% of the future tokens in order to fund development, onboard industry participants such as the DMA and their members orgs,  a nd pay for legal  a nalyses. The pre-sale of tokens  were to specifically identified participants who have an interest in seeing the adChain platform become a transformative  p rotocol  w ithin  th e advertising  te chnology  in dustry. The  1 0%  o f pre-sale tokens represent 100 million of  t he 1 billion tokens to be distributed at  t he public launch, contemplated to take place in late June, 2017. \\nThe token breakdown is as follows: \\n! ! ! ! \\n500 million to be distributed in a public token sale with a cap of $10 million sold 200 million reserved for MetaX, per the time lock schedule detailed below \\n200 million reserved for ConsenSys, per the time lock schedule detailed below \\n100 million sold to fund development via multiple pre-sale agreements (as described above) \\nConsenSys and MetaX will jointly deliver on the roadmap outlined in this white paper. It is the belief of  ConsenSys and MetaX that token launches in this ecosystem may be naive in selling upwards of 75%  during their first “token round.” Typical startups would exhibit an even greater failure rate if they limited  their startup capital to only one funding round. ConsenSys and MetaX believe it is better to sell tokens  over time as i) adChain achieves its targeted adoption milestones across the digital advertising industry  and ii) ConsenSys and MetaX continue to develop and release new advancements of the adChain  protocol. As such, ConsenSys and MetaX believe it is in the best interest of the platform to retain 40% of  the tokens after the first public sale. This gives the adChain team flexibility to initiate future token sales if  warranted.  \\nConsenSys and MetaX plan to use part of the 40% retained tokens held in escrow as bounties for the  community to build specifically desired functionality. After year one when governance is more fully  fleshed out in the adChain protocol, ConsenSys and MetaX plan to post tokens in escrow and have token  \\npg. 12 \\n\\n========12========\\n\\nholders vote on whether or not submissions satisfy requirements of our bounties  - this ensures that  ConsenSys and MetaX push further into decentralized control over the adChain system. \\nTo signal the level of commitment both ConsenSys and MetaX have for this system, each entity has  agreed to lock up all of their tokens with the following unlocking schedule: \\n! ! \\n50% unlocked 1 year after public sale \\nRemaining tokens unlocked 18 months after public sale \\nFuture Work In adChain \\nThe adChain Registry and TLS authentication scheme proposed is production-ready to support server- side header bidding. To conduct server-side header bidding means a publisher or its proxy solicits bid  requests from the demand side directly, without an exchange acting as an intermediary. Server-side  header bidding has been gaining traction in advertising technology independently of the rise of  blockchains because it provides bid transparency to publishers and removes a middleman from the  demand-supply relationship.9 It works well with adChain because it is a peer-to-peer technology which  maps onto many of the design patterns becoming prevalent in the emerging field of cryptosystems. One  factor which has impeded the adoption of header bidding throughout the industry is the problem of  “discovery”, or identifying the entity on the other side of an inbound bid request. The adChain Registry is  a breakthrough for discovery in header bidding, as the bid request recipient can determine whether an  otherwise unknown entity is reputable simply by authenticating it over TLS and checking whether it has  an adChain listing. \\nA long-term objective is to bring the benefits of blockchains and the adChain Registry to users whose needs cannot be fully satisfied by server-side header bidding. Enabling discovery for client-side header  bidding will be highly desirable as the web decentralizes, and supporting authentication over multi-hop  supply chains will be a breakthrough necessary for the construction of fully programmatic ad-hoc supply  chains. Using blockchains and content-addressed file systems to verify the delivery and display of ad  markup could eliminate an entire category of ad fraud. Strong attribution of identity-linked actions is a  holy grail for programmatic web advertising potentially made possible by open identity systems such as  uPort. \\nDiscovery For Client -Side Header Bidding \\nLike server-side header bidding, client-side header bidding disintermediates exchanges and enables supply  to engage in ad commerce with demand directly and peer-to-peer. As the name implies, client-side header  bidding requests originate in the browser rather than on a publisher-controlled server. Because secrets  cannot be safely stored in browsers, authenticating supply when requests originate in the browser cannot  be done using bidirectional TLS. It may become feasible to utilize emerging client-side signing standards  to construct something like an adChain user registry, or even do so as a function of open attestation  \\n9 \\n “ Envisioning The Future In A Server-Side Header Bidding World”. Rachel Parkin. AdExchanger. February 1,  2017. \\npg. 13 \\n\\n========13========\\n\\nmappings on an existing identity system. Rather than authenticate the publisher, it should be possible to  authenticate the user. \\nDeep Supply Chain Auditing \\nThe adChain Registry allows for advertisers to authenticate bid requesters as registrants in a clean pool of  supply in a direct, peer-to-peer manner. In practice, most ad exchange today is conducted over multi-hop  supply chains. Our approach for authentication using mutual TLS is not useful for authentication  between entities in a supply chain which are not directly connected with one another. This is to say, one  can authenticate the individual they are speaking with, but not who that individual is speaking for in-band  to bidirectional TLS itself (“I am bar.net. I am working for baz.net who is working for foo.net”). To do so  will require novel application-layer authentication logic involving diffs on ad markup and signature  bundling. \\nCreative Verification \\nA registry could be used to allow adChain members to register hashes of individual creative assets and  metadata. The metadata could include the creative media type, its IAB Content Taxonomy  \\ncategorization and its dimensions, for example. This registry could be used to do proactive verification of  creative throughout the supply chain, or allow publishers to blacklist classes of ads by metadata. \\nTracker Tag Registry \\nA registry that allows analytics providers to register a hash of their javascript tracking tags. These tags are  used to track user engagement with advertisements on web pages, but are sometimes corrupted by hackers  and used as malware vectors to install ransomware on the computers of unsuspecting people surfing the  web. If the adChain community could enforce a vetting process for new tracker tags, and publishers could  verify tracking tags before running them, it would be harder to spread malware through advertising.  \\nStrong Attribution For Identity-Linked Actions \\nA holy grail of web advertising technology is a demand-centric attribution protocol with provable  performance metrics. When advertisers pay for performance rather than impressions, it no longer matters  whether an impression is a human or a bot; if the impression results in a purchase, the advertiser’s  ultimate objective has been met. \\nIn general, attribution for actions in web advertising is low-quality. It is very difficult to measure whether  a product was purchased as the result of the purchaser having viewed advertisements unless the purchase  happens in a click-through. Even then, it remains difficult to attribute credit for that purchase to  advertisements for the same product the user may have viewed previously on different publisher sites.  Advertisers simply do not know whether what they are doing really works, and publishers are disinclined  to provide such information because it is more profitable for them to bill by eyeballs than by performance. \\nCookie-syncing and all the black magic of adtech on the web has not produced a good attribution  technology for the open web to-date. Open identity systems running on blockchains have the potential to  \\npg. 14 \\n\\n========14========\\n\\nprovide all the richness and assurance of data harvestable by closed social media platforms and finally  provide the kernel of persistence necessary for strong attributions on the open web. \\nAdvanced Voting and Governance Systems \\nadToken holders are able to participate directly in voting on applications for listing in the adChain  Registry. It will be desirable to empower adToken holders to safely delegate their votes to smart contracts  like Gnosis prediction markets, or to trusted representatives in a similar vein to proof-of-work mining pool  participation. \\nAnother direction to explore is time-locking tokens used in voting, which has been discussed by Vitalik  Buterin and others.10 Time-locking tokens used in voting could increase voter stake in the adChain  community beyond the tactical game of vote outcomes, because positions could only be exited over a  strategic timeframe. \\nImpression Tracking  \\nBeyond facilitating discovery for peer-to-peer header bidding, adChain can also be extended to function  as an accounting tool for near-realtime impression tracking. For traditional ad contracts with 30 to 60 day  settlement cycles, discrepancies in impression reporting between parties are not discovered until the  contract is complete. Discrepancies in tracked impressions commonly reach up to 20%.11 Some of these  are intrinsic to browsers and networks and come from latency, network connection errors, ad blockers,  and differences between ad server spam filtering techniques. The widespread acceptance of discrepancies  across the industry, however, is exploited through fraudulent tampering of metrics and misreporting  impressions. \\nUsing state channels, an advanced technique which allows for secure off-chain transactions that are  instant, private, and cost zero gas, impression events can be synchronized between peers in real time,  eliminating a category of fraud. The state channel implementation to track impressions has already been  prototyped and the code and documentation is on GitHub here:  \\nhttps://github.com/adChain/AdMarket. Once deployed, this will be the first production-ready state  channel implementation, and it will be operating at web scale, with the ability to process billions of  impressions per day, secured by smart contracts on Ethereum. \\nMicropayments and a True Three -Sided Advertising Market \\nAs described above, the first AdMarket implementation will primarily be used for accounting; the actual  payments will happen out-of-band through traditional bank transfers. In time, the AdMarket state  channel implementation will transition to a true micropayments system. In this system, advertisers will pay  publishers tiny amounts on every cleared impression, to be settled periodically on-chain.  \\nThrough Ethereum wallet browser extensions such as MetaMask, users will also be able to participate in  the market for their attention by automatically paying the publishers of the websites they visit the fair  \\n                                                  \\n10 \\n“On Coin-lock voting, Futarchy and Optimal Decentralized Governance”.

Further, if users choose not to  block ads, publishers can choose to share their advertising earnings with them.  \\nReal Time Data Streams \\nThe adChain protocols can be extended to facilitate discovery and purchase of real-time data streams of  user engagement with advertisements for micropayments over state channels. This can either be sold by  advertisers and publishers who capture this data or, in what would represent a paradigm shift, by users  themselves. Users with Ethereum wallet browser extensions could capture and store their own data, and  sell authenticated data streams linked to their identities (if they choose) to analytics providers, advertising  retargeters and resellers, and other buyers.  \\npg. 16 \\n\\n========16========\\n\\nWhitepaper \\n\\n========1========\\n\\nAbstract  \\nToday  the  penetration  of  basic  principles and  benefits of  using  blockchain is  everywhere: it can be encountered in the game and entertainment industries as well as in  the most important activity spheres of society  – health care, education, personnel market,  payment networks, and investments, and even in the organization of the  electoral process.  \\nThe form of attracting investments into such spheres has changed as well  – having  gone  from  writing  business  plans  and  supplying  them  to  banks  to  be  presented  in  the  offices of leading venture funds  to rapid development of digital circuits of crowdinvesting  funding called ICO in the professional sphere.  \\nIn other words, investing has come to full tokenization of this important process. \\nAt the same time, already in the period of its formation and  early development ICO  caused resentment from a number of regulators, disappointed investors and the expert  community.  \\nThe  reasons  for  this  are  simple  – the  same  economic  laws  operate  in  a  world  of  crypto-currency venture  investments  just  as  in  the  sphere  of  traditional  classic  startups:  90% of all beginnings are going to be closed because of a number of reasons – lack of  financing, absence of necessary experience and skills in the team , while sometimes just  the irrelevance of the product or service in the market.   \\nSystemizing  all  of  its  cumula ting experience  in  the  investment  sphere,  OnPlace  focused  all  of  its  attention  on  one  prioritized  direction  of  developing  financial  markets,  chiefly  through  the  ICO  mechanisms  – investing  into  the  businesses  of  closed  private  companies. \\nWe can say with abs olute certainty that investment into private IT companies has  become one of the most reliable ways to get a high  return percentage on investments in a  relatively short period of time.  \\nDeveloping the concept of the tokenization  protocol of PATS, the OnPlac e team  set before itself  the goal to lay the foundations in the partial  realization  of objectives to transition ICO to a new level: \\na) The token offers of IT companies actively leading their business  \\nb) The tokens of the best development teams and employers in  the world \\nc) The  tokens which  are  responsible  for  innovative  solutions and  which  have  \\nproven their necessity in the technology market \\nd) The  tokens  with  a  working  financial  model  /  a  monetization  model  and  with  \\nmillions of users of the service around the world  \\ne) The  tokens  which  have  been  invested  into  by  the  biggest  traditional  VC  \\ninvestors of the world \\nBelow  we  present  to  you  detailed  specifications  of  our  PATS  (Private  Assets  Tokenization  System)  protocol  that  will  allow  the  community  of  investors  to  make  decisions  in  regards  to the  distribution  and  movement  of  the  above  assets  in  a  decentralized manner.  \\n1 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========2========\\n\\nThe concept of PATS protocol. The use of the protocol for the tokenization of  OTC assets \\nIn each time period the market presents limited offers to invest in shares of private  companies that comply in full with the criteria of the most secure and potentially lucrative  investments.  \\nTokenization  of  such  investment  options  based  on  the  application  of  the PATS  protocol assumes a certain procedure:  \\na) Formation of the Marketplace opportunity window \\nb) Selection  of  projects  for  tokenization  based  on  criteria  and  community  \\ndiscussions of crypto -investors  \\nc) Tokenization of the selected projects of underlying assets using PATS  \\nd) Establishment and initial  input of PATS tokens of underlying assets  into liquid  \\ncirculation  \\ne) Support of tokens during their life cycle, ensuring a fully decentralized control  \\nof the token by the token holders community \\n2 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========3========\\n\\n3 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========4========\\n\\n1. Formation of Marketplace opportunity window (MOW) and selection of projects  for tokenization \\nWhen creating a pool of  Marketplace  opportunity  window (MOW) projects related to investing in private  companies, modern methods of assessing business metrics will be applied.  Business selection for investment will be made taking into account its compliance with a number of criteria: \\n1) Work in the most promising and fast -growing segments of the IT market (it may  be  specialized  in  FinTech,  Data  bases,  \\nB2B,  Communications,  AI,  data  analysis,  \\nVR, payments, and ma ny others ) \\n2)  Positive  dynamics  of  key  indicators and the company\\'s operational  business  metrics,  for  example:  stable  quarterly  revenue  growth  rates  (annual)  and customers / services users increase \\n3)  Successfully  conducted  fund ing  round stages “seed” and “A” \\n4)  Been  funded  by  leading  VC  (several funds) at earlier stages \\n5) Strong competitive position in the  industry,  and  absence  of  big  monopolist  competitors.  Presence  and  successful  development of similar products / services  in the markets of other regions \\nThe development of the protocol and the first wave of  improved functionality assume the implementation of a community participation mechanism in the formation of MOW,  and selection of projects via voting.  \\n2. Tokenization  of  selected  projects  of  underlying organization of liquid circulation of tokens \\nassets  with  PATS  usage,  \\nFundamentally, the concept of tokenization assumes the following: everything that  happens within the digital accounting system must have legal force, just as changes in the  real estate registry lead to the change of  land or building ownership. Tokenization in the  modern understanding of blockchain has changed its approach in managing all assets:  instead of administrating via orders, the asset is controlled directly through recordings in  the smart contract, which are essentially analogous to the digital signature.  \\nApplying such an approach to the management of traditional assets always brings  obvious  benefits:  it  significantly  reduces  costs,  expands  access  for  a  large  number  of  participants,  increases  the  speed  and  safety  of  asset  handling,  allows  complete  control  and audit.  \\n4 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========5========\\n\\nAny commercial infrastructure for different classes of assets and properties involves  a number of complex components: a depository (a register that keeps records of assets  and  rights),  the  stock  exchange  (of  the  bidding  process  organizer),  elements  of  the  settlement center. Tokenization before us based on blockchain  suggests that all of these  components will be integrated as efficiently as possible, while allowing decentralization of  the entire infrastructure, having distributed storage functions and processing transactions between all parties involved.     \\nThe  main  task  facing  the  OnPlace  team  during  the  development  of  the  protocol  tokenization  of  investments  into  shares  of  private  companies  became  the  creation  of  a  universal scalable instrument for providing a maximally  transparent  and  safe  solution  in  the OTC investment field.  \\nThe  use of  our  protocol  allowed  us  to  solve  this  problem  and  enfor ce  a  set  of  mandatory conditions:  \\na) Use of a secure and standardized channel of account management based on  \\nsmart contracts \\nb) Decentralization of audit and participants’ decision -making  \\nc) Integration of management principles directly into the asset itself  \\nScaling  solutions  based  on  the  PATS  protocol  will  open  potential  access  for  any  person  in  the  world  to  purchase OTC  assets.  Further  development  of  functional  opportunities of the protocol should allow simple connection of additional business -logic  modules  opened  by  API  based  on  the  architecture through  improvement  of  smart  contracts, the possibility of real-time transparent audit with access to results for all parties,  the possibility of collective asset management  without requiring trust, opportunity to work  with  any  trading  platform,  adding  to  tokenized  assets  supplementary  properties  and  attributes, the possibili ty of proving the history of ownership, the possibility of separating  a tokenized asset into the smallest fractions.  \\nBelow  are  the  definitions  of  key  concepts  and  terms  used  further  on  in  the  document:  \\nTokenization - the  process  of  creating  a  digital  tok en  in  accordance  with the  technology of smart contracts, which is based on  a specific underlying asset.  Tokenization  is the  process  of  transforming  the  storage  and  management  of  an  asset,  wherein  each  asset is given a corresponding digital  double.  \\nAn  Underlying  Asset – an  asset,  on  which  the  derivative  financial  instrument  is  based, the financial derivative. In the context of this document, the underlying assets are  assets of private companies not involved in  the stock exchange turnover.  \\n5 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========6========\\n\\nA Derivative – a contract, by which the parties receive the right or commit to carry - out  some  actions  in  regards  to  an  underlying  asset.  Usually,  opportunities  to  buy,  sell,  provide,  obtain  certain  goods  or  stocks  are  envisaged.  In  contrast  to  a  direct  Sale  and Purchase Agreement, a derivative is formal and standard, initially providing a possibility  for at least one of the parties to freely sell this contract. The price of a derivative and the  character of its changes are closely related to the price of  the underlying asset.  \\nThe  Token  Holder  or  the  Investor – any  person  or  user  of  blockchain  that  has  received tokens created via using the PATS protocol directly from the protocol developer  or from other former holders. \\nPrivate Assets Tokenization System (PATS)  – a protocol created by the OnPlace  team,  which  allows  investors  (the  holders  of  issued  tokens)  to  monitor  and  control  operations over tokenized assets.  \\nAfter completing the project selection stage OnPlace legislates legal preparations  and  develops  an  agreement,  wi thin  the  limits  of  which  property  rights  over a part  of  private company shares (an underlying asset of a token) are transferred to future holders  of the created tokens.  \\nThe implementation of protocol tokenization is designed to solve a set of difficulties  arising in the classical scheme of venture investment:  \\n- \\nA high input threshold for most investors; \\n- \\nHigh transactional costs for processing  deals; \\n- \\nThe lack of  complete information necessary to assess investment risks and assess  potential cost of asset growth; \\n- \\nDifficulties  in  the  realization  of  an  effective  mechanism  of  audit  and  control  of  investments; \\n- \\nLack of sufficient (“secondary”) liquidity of investments; \\n- \\nA complex exiting process. \\n6 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========7========\\n\\nPrinciples and the mechanism of tokenization of underlying assets included in MOW \\nWe have developed PATS (Private Assets Tokenization System) protocol, which will  allow the community of investors to make decisions in a decentralized manner in regards  to  the  further  distribution  and  motion  of  tokenized  assets.  The  use  of  the  protocol  wil l  mean that each decision  in connection to transactions over tokens will be recorded in a  network with its own blockchain and will not be subject to change.  \\nTo  solve  the  problem  of  commissioning  closed  assets  into  circulation  (shares  of  private companies) in stock turnover, we use Ethereum solutions, which allow the creation  of personal units of account in blockchain and contracts for managing them. \\nEvery underlying asset implemented using PATS protocol will be represented by a  separate  private  token  and  endowed  logic  of  decentralized  management  of  PATS  protocol.  \\nThis  approach is  based  on  the  idea  of  creating  a  Decentralized  Autonomous  Organization,  in  which  each  holder  of  a  token  is  able  to  directly  affect the  asset  and  determine  further  operations  over  tokens  via  voting.  Thus,  each  decision  in  regards  to  operating over tokens will be registered in a network and will not be subject to change.  Together  with the managing  and  monitoring  functions,  PATS  protocol  provides  autonomous  safety of  investors’  balances  from  losing  funds  during  the  emission  and  closing of shares.   \\nBasic PATS functions allow the investor (the holder of tokens issued on the  basis of  the protocol) to: \\n- \\nDetermine the closing date of an asset \\n- \\nAdd new assets for examination \\n- \\nVote for the emission of tokens of underlying assets / change the parameters of  circulating tokens \\n7 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========8========\\n\\n- \\nProduce  equivalent  trade  of  tokens  of  the  PATS  protocol  dire ctly,  without  using  third-party stock exchanges  \\nIn the next versions of functionality improvement of the capacities of the protocol the  following capacities will be added: \\n- \\nTemporary halt of selling an asset \\n- \\nAbility  to  add  underlying  assets  of  third  partie s  into  the  PATS  system  using  its  specifications independently from the developer of the protocol.  \\nTokenization  of  investments  in  private  IT  company  shares  on  the  basis  of  PATS  will  allow obtaining exceptional opportunities in expanding the circle of poten tial participants  in  the  investment  process,  while  combining  in  itself  the  most  significant  benefits  of  the  protocol  – high safety level, transparency in the form of an integrated audit mechanism  and the liquidity of investments (free circulation as crypto -currency assets). Using OnPlace  blockchain networks based on PATS will reduce transaction costs for holders more than  10 times in comparison to traditional investment methods (the average fee will not exceed  0.1%).  \\nAll PATS tokens which will be  formed, represented and imputed into circulation on  our platform, will be provided with real assets  – private company shares. \\n8 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========9========\\n\\nEvery token will have a set of required attributes reflected below: \\nUnderlying asset of a token \\nCharacteristics of an under lying asset: \\n- Company name \\n- Number and type of shares  \\nconstituting the underlying asset \\n- Value of funds invested in the  \\nformation of the asset \\nToken of a financial asset (a derivative  \\ncreated by PATS protocol) Characteristics of a token (PATS derivative) \\n- Token name \\n- Number of issued tokens \\n- Amount of rights granted to token  \\nholders \\nDimension / number of the underlying asset  Current token price in the stock exchange  \\nproviding the derivative \\nThe period and features of paying off the  underlying asset  \\ncirculation \\nCurrent price for one unit of underlying  asset (share) \\nTokenized assets will be available to a wide range of crypto -investors that have  passed standard procedures in accordance to the requirements of KYC/AML. \\nAll PATS tokens will become tools of organized trades realized on their own  OnPlace trading platform, specialized  on decentralized management and control of their  circulation and liquidity.

Its annul size in the last 3 years ex ceeded $100 billion, which  practically exceeds  twice the amount of investments in 2010  – 2013. \\n10 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========11========\\n\\nThe  largest  market  segments  (more  than  80%)  in  the  regional  focus  are  USA  and  China, which account for  $71.8 and $31 billion respectively.  \\nWhile the Asian region is characterized by stable and positive growth of investment  \\nthe project – financing stages B / C / D  – accounts  for  at  least  50%  of  the  total  investment size. \\nThe  size  of  investments  in  one project  (within  one  transaction)  o n  average is about $4.8 million in the early  stages,  in  the  later  ones  already  about  10.0.  If  one  considers  these  numbers  within specific series of financing, round  A  on  average  will  require  about  $5  million, while subsequent rounds  – about  $10-12 million. \\nsize,  for  the  USA  and  Europe  mixed  dynamics  of  investments  are  more  typical.  \\nThe  absolute  industry  segment-leader  remains  the  IT  solutions domain,  software,  digital  products and services. At  the  same  time  the  share  of  investments  in  the  developmental  stage  of  \\nThus,  the  venture  investments  market  is  actively developing:  in  the  medium  term positive growth and 2 -fold index increase within 3-5 years can be expected. Its most active  segment  is  the  sphere  of  IT  solutions.  Constant  high  growth  rates  d emonstrate  the investment index in the Asian region, especially in its leading region  – China.  \\n11 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========12========\\n\\nb) Crypto currency market \\nThe total capitalization of crypto -currencies (today there are just over 800 of them)  by the end of  October 2017 exceeded $ 180 billion, completely restoring its levels after a  recent  decline  based  on  the  prohibition  of  bitcoin  trading    and  input  of  restriction  on  conducting ICO in China . This is ten times more than on January 1, 2017, and 25 times  more than on January 1, 2016. At the moment, the mark et capitalization is comparable in  size to the stock market capitalization of Qatar or Ireland.  \\nSource: http://coinmarketcap.com \\nAt the end of October 2017, 12 crypto -currencies have a capitalization in excess of $  1  billion,  and  total  of  their  share  was  89%  of  the  total  market  capitalization.  The  lion\\'s  share of capitalization is, of course, Bitcoin. Now it occupies about 70% of the market, and  more  recently  - on  January  1,  2017  - BTC  accounted  for  87%  of  the  total  market  capitalization. Thus, in the  last ten months the share of BTC has seriously decreased, while  the altcoins demonstrate a faster growth in value. \\nIn themselves, crypto-currencies can be divided into two types: directly currencies  (that is, payment instruments or elements of the payment  infrastructure) and crypto-assets  (a rough analogue of the share  - a share in the project). In the total capitalization of the  market,  crypto  assets  still  hold  a  small  share:  only  about  4%,  while  maintaining  a  large  growth  potential.  Also  on  the  market  app eared  crypto-currencies,  which  are  an  infrastructural  function  for  crypto  assets,  a  kind  of  superstructure  for  the  functioning  of  crypto assets. And it was the appearance of crypto assets that caused Bitcoin to decrease  in the total market capitalization. \\nIn the medium-term perspective for 3-5 years most industry experts keep the high  expectations of market capitalization growth rates. The most authoritative experts believe  that the growth will be from 50 to 100% per year . \\n12 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========13========\\n\\nc) Segment market analysis of  private IT companies \\nThe  profitability  of  investing  in  the  business  of  the  most  successful  IT  companies  implemented  in  our  service  is  the  most  realistic  alternative  to  investing  in  crypto - currencies: see the presented calculations below. \\nSource:  calculations \\ncompany  \\ndata,  \\ndata  from \\nhttps://www.crunchbase.com ,  OnPlace \\nThat  is,  on  average,  investments  in  the  portfolio  of  private  companies  ensure  an  investment growth of 8–10 times or about 200% per year. \\nAt  the  same time,  such  investments  allow  to  reduce  investment  risks  to  a  minimum  because they are not subject to high volatility, are provided with a diversified structure of  the investment portfolio, and even with the fall of individual stocks, they allow to remain  the overall portfolio of investments in the profit zone. \\nIf we consider the current market of investments in private companies,  shares of  the following companies can be highlighted as  the most appropriate projects for potential  investments and MOW formation at the time of  writing the document : Slack, Zenreach. The  most  telling  examples of business  capitalization  growth  that  could  become  investments  with  the  use  of  PATS  in  2012-2014  (3-5  years  ago)  are  UBER,  Spotify,  Xiaomi, Airbnb, Palantir .  \\nAs  the  results  of  the  comparative  analysis  for  the  last  number  of  years  show,  for  investments  into  traditional  stock  exchange  assets  and  property  objects  the  return  is  rather limited and was at a moderate level: from 1.5% a year for art obj ects to a maximum  of 9.0% for fairly volatile real estate market.  \\nAt  the  same  time  the  average  annual  return  from  investing  into  businesses  of  leading  private  IT  companies  is  estimated  at  about  100-200%, and  in  some  cases  can  reach up to 500% (which is broadly comparable with  the revenue from the price growth  of individual crypto -shares, but at a much lower risk of investing).  \\n13 \\nOnPlace Inc. / PATS protocol version 1.1 \\n\\n========14========\\n\\nSource: LAToken asset platform data,  OnPlace calculations \\nFinancial expectations.

In the United States alone, over a dozen online gaming sites have either gone bankrupt or been forcefully shut down by authorities since 2011, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in deposits that have yet to be returned to players. Despite these setbacks, the industry continues to grow, and players continue to risk depositing their funds into centrally owned and operated gaming websites. \\nProvably fair online gaming is badly needed. Enter Peerplays, a solution for provably fair blockchain-based gaming that allows users to design their own specialized tokens or chips, buy or sell gateway tokens for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether and then wager these tokens in on-chain games. \\nThere is no “house” in Peerplays, but instead players are matched with other users for peer-to-peer gameplay through a series of smart contracts. These contracts escrow the funds wagered by each player and then release them to the winner \\u200bafter specific conditions within a game are met and verified. Smart contracts are built directly into the native blockchain code rather than a virtual scripting machine, which makes transaction processing fast enough to enable millions of players to interact almost simultaneously. \\n\\n========2========\\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\xa0 \\nI\\u200bntroduction \\nBlockchain Consensus \\nNative Smart Contracts \\nProvably Fair Gaming \\nProfit Sharing \\nFee distribut\\u200bion Flowchart \\nMega-Jackpots and PowerUp Points \\nOpen Source GUI \\nTrustless Asset Exchange \\nWagering \\nHosted (Public) Client Portals \\nServer-Side Tournament Hosting \\nConclusion \\nReferences \\n\\n========3========\\n\\nIntroduction \\nA Peer-to-Peer Marketplace is an online exchange that brings people and/or businesses together to deal with each other directly without having to go through traditional slow and expensive multi-party networks. In these marketplaces, motivated individuals with resources and specific skills or talents can simply connect with willing customers through a 3rd party “dispatch” service, consisting of either an online platform or mobile app to facilitate a commercial exchange of goods or services and payment between the buyer and seller. Airbnb, eBay, Etsy, Freelancer, Kickstarter, Mr. Delivery, and Uber are examples of the most successful of Peer-to-Peer networking models today. \\nWith the advent of blockchain technologies, and specifically the platform called G\\u200braphene,\\u200bit is now possible to launch a peer-to-peer dispatch service that runs almost entirely on its own. Graphene is a\\u200bn open-source, MIT licensed, decentralized blockchain technology that utilizes a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, w\\u200bhich leverages the power of stakeholder voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. Commercial interactions between users facilitated by Graphene are cheaper and faster than a traditional company due to greatly reduced overhead costs, while membership and operational criteria is still flexible enough to grow and adapt through a democratic process. \\nEven better, all actions on the blockchain are publicly accessible for audit and verification, eliminating the possibility of cheating. And since decentralized blockchains cannot easily be turned off or shut down by external agencies, blockchain-based companies may be among the first organizations in history to enjoy complete global autonomy. This has recently sparked a worldwide movement to promote and explore blockchain technologies as a potential catalyst for new social, political, cooperative, and for-profit business models. \\nOne such model addressed by Peerplays is the creation of a provably fair and auditable gaming platform, because the online betting and gambling industry has been constantly plagued with accusations of fraud and cheating by both players and system administrators.\\u200b1 Peerplays also offers an alternative for payment processing of wagers, as the current legacy system often involves complex legal compliance hurdles which have to be dealt with separately in each country of operation.\\u200b2 If payment processing can be outsourced to a decentralized blockchain, 3rd party gaming partners can unburden themselves in ways that lower the barrier to entry into the marketplace. \\n\\n========4========\\n\\nBlockchain Consensus \\nGraphene, the technology behind Peerplays, is the same platform used by BitShares, Steem, and Muse. It currently offers the fastest block production times and the highest throughput of any decentralized blockchain consensus mechanism available - supporting 3 second blocks and a potential throughput capacity of over 100,000 transactions per second.3\\u200bOn a Graphene-based blockchain, stakeholders elect trusted signing “witnesses”, and a periodic, randomly chosen deterministic block signing order allows each witness to know when their turn to sign is approaching. Thus, block production speed is only limited by the bandwidth capacity of the signing nodes and the speed of light - which is about 1 second for a packet to circle the globe - meaning a high bandwidth network could achieve about 1 second average block times. \\nThe high throughput capacity of a Graphene-based blockchain is due to a number of architectural specifications modelled after the LMAX (online FX trading) exchange, which has achieved upwards of 6 million transactions per second (TPS).\\u200b4 Some of these highly streamlined design parameters include the l\\u200bimiting of the core business logic to a single thread, the removing of cryptographic operations (hashes and signatures) from the core business logic, the division of validation into state-dependent and state-independent checks, the use of an object oriented data model, and keeping databases memory-resident.5\\u200b \\nAdding new features to a Graphene blockchain requires stakeholder approval, but this process is a largely seamless experience for users because most will use the lightweight or hosted clients, and only full nodes are required to upgrade. On the BitShares network, for example, hard forks usually take a few hours and disruption for most users is minimal to none. \\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\n\\n========5========\\n\\nNative Smart Contracts \\nHere is what Daniel Larimer, lead developer for Graphene, says about running Smart Contracts on Graphene: \\nThe BitShares Decentralized Asset Exchange uses an order matching algorithm which is a wonderful example of one such “natively supported” smart contract.\\u200b6 \\n\\u200bThis \\nfeature allows buy and sell orders between users to be filled instantly and has been proven in stress tests to handle thousands of unique transactions per second.\\u200b7 Furthermore, we can use the analogy o\\u200bf “opening and filling orders” within a marketplace to describe Peerplays \\u200bplayer matching - the operation through which players interact with one another using the gaming tournament smart contracts. \\nTo begin the process, each player opens an “order” which is then accepted and “filled” by the appropriate on-chain smart contract. The smart contract then matches pairs or groups of players together, arbitrates the terms and rules of the game between players and releases the funds to the winner. We have coined the term \\u200bPeerplays Marketplace\\u200bto describe this feature. \\nStep 1: A Player opens/broadcasts an \\u200bOffer to Contract\\u200b, henceforth referred to as OTC, into the Peerplays Marketplace. Each OTC contains the appropriate funds to buy-in to the desired game, as well as other data required to define the terms in which he wishes to engage in the desired game or tournament. \\nStep 2:\\u200bOTCs are matched by a player matching (order matching) algorithm. \\n\\n========6========\\n\\nStep 3: After players are matched, game play begins and players voluntarily interact (compete) with each other to fulfill the conditions set forth by the rules of the particular game or tournament and their agreement with the Smart Contract. \\nStep 4: Funds are unlocked by the Smart Contract and sent to the winner, minus any fees which the blockchain automatically distributes to the appropriate places via profit sharing (section 4). \\nAdditionally, an essential element for most games on Peerplays includes the on-chain Random Number Generator (RNG) and shuffle program which can generate numbers which are then encrypted to a player’s private/public key pairing and published on the blockchain. Players are then able to publish or reveal blinded cryptographic signatures to “prove” their positions or holdings in the game, and fast and reliable block times means they can do so with the speed and frequency necessary to facilitate real-time gameplay for on-chain casino card games, popular board games, and other games of skill. \\nProvably Fair Gaming \\nPeerplays is a universally auditable platform. All smart contracts are written in open-source code, so it is easy to verify that they are functioning as advertised. By broadcasting an OTC, each player essentially enters into an “arbitration agreement” with the blockchain, after which time their only recourse is to follow the rules. The release of escrowed funds is always dependent on voluntary moves (or lack thereof) on the part of each player, so failure to perform these actions in a timely manner, or failure to produce the “winning hand” automatically removes a player’s eligibility to receive the jackpot payout. \\nBy way of explanation, let us create a hypothetical game called \\u200bHigh Card\\u200b. Here are the rules of this game: \\nTwo players place an initial wager (ante), and then each is dealt a single card from a 52 card deck. After each player looks at her card, a round of betting ensues, or either player can fold. If both remain, then each reveals their card and the highest card wins. (Note: suits would also have to be ranked from high to low, for example diamonds low, then clubs, then hearts, and then spades high.) \\nTo play this game on Peerplays, each player opens an OTC for the game which includes the appropriate ante. After they are matched, the smart contract locks up their funds and the RNG \\n\\n========7========\\n\\ndeals each of them a card “face down” - meaning each player’s card is published on the blockchain but encrypted to their private/public key pair. \\nThen, they are each be able to view their individual cards without revealing it to the other, and make their decisions on whether to bet or fold. Betting involves sending additional funds to the smart contract to escrow. If either player folds, then the smart contract releases the funds to the other player. If one bets and the other calls, or if both pass on the round of betting, then it is time to reveal the cards. \\nTo do this, each user must publish the decrypted version of their secret, which can then be proved to be equal to the encrypted version by re-encrypting it with their public key. This “proof” is validated automatically by the blockchain code when the user publishes the decrypted version. The smart contract then awards the funds to the player with the higher card. If either player fails to reveal their proof within a certain time limit, they automatically forfeit the jackpot. \\nAt launch, Peerplays will allow players to choose single-elimination tournament brackets which facilitate multi-player tournaments by pairing off players in head-to-head competition through a series of rounds. The randomized player matching algorithm will prevent or greatly reduce the ability for players to collude, and individual head-to-head games are not subject to collusion in the same way as multi-player tables. \\nThese are just a few of the basic tools and features which will be available on Peerplays. Using only these functions we have outlined here, an almost unlimited variety of on-chain games can be written and implemented. \\nProfit Sharing \\nThe Peerplays network earns revenue from various operations like the creation and trading of digital asset tokens by users, and the performance of certain custom operations, but most notably from the rake - which is a percentage of each jackpot deducted as a fee. This model allows the network to financially benefit from the trustless arbitration of each tournament and thus prevents Peerplays from having to act as a “house” and bet against its users. \\nEvery time a fee is collected, the blockchain automatically splits it into a virtual account governed by a smart contract which distributes the fees in three directions. \\u200bThe largest percentage is distributed at regular intervals into the accounts of Peerplays core token holders as profit sharing. \\u200bThis means that core token holders receive a portion of every jackpot paid in any of the \\u200bcertified wagering instruments\\u200b, along with a portion of the rest of the \\n\\n========8========\\n\\nnetwork fees. Another term for the core tokens is \\u200bFee-Backed Assets or \\u200bFBAs\\u200b, because they entitle the holder to a portion of the fees collected by the network.\\u200b8\\u200bThe next portion is directed towards blockchain maintenance, such as for paying block producers and fixing bugs. And the third portion is sent to the M\\u200bega-Jackpot virtual accumulation account (outlined in the next section). All of these fees and percentages are determined by the elected Peerplays Committee members, who are voted for by the Peerplays token holders. \\nThe\\xa0flowchart\\xa0below\\xa0explains\\xa0how\\xa0player’s\\xa0fees\\xa0are\\xa0distributed\\xa0 \\nNote: Hosted clients never have control over players funds, they merely offer an “access point” into Peerplays. \\nMega-Jackpots and PowerUp Points \\nMega-Jackpot tournaments are a way for the Peerplays network to occasionally become the sponsor of large tournament jackpots by utilizing the network’s unique “profit sharing” capabilities. Peerplays automatically allocates a small percentage of every network fee into a smart contract-secured virtual account called the M\\u200bega-Jackpot Fund.\\u200bThis smart contract then automatically schedules and hosts Mega-Jackpot tournament events, and the funds are unlocked and instantly transferred to the tournament winners. \\nPowerUp points are the user-reward tokens of the Peerplays network, and are distributed according to win-loss records and amounts wagered, among other factors. PowerUp is the only token accepted as the buy-in fee for Mega-Jackpot tournaments, so they will be in high demand during Mega-Jackpot sign up periods. They are tradeable on the asset exchange, and \\n\\n========9========\\n\\nplayers can use them for purchases, rewards, or include them in sponsored Jackpot pools for their own Custom tournaments. \\nOpen Source GUI \\nAll\\xa0the\\xa0operations\\xa0for\\xa0regular\\xa0gameplay\\xa0on\\xa0Peerplays\\xa0will\\xa0be\\xa0integrated\\xa0into\\xa0a\\xa0basic\\xa0open\\xadsource\\xa0 Graphic\\xa0User\\xa0Interface\\xa0(GUI)\\xa0for\\xa0a\\xa0seamless\\xa0user\\xa0experience.\\xa0This\\xa0GUI\\xa0will\\xa0be\\xa0published\\xa0and\\xa0 maintained,\\xa0 exposing\\xa0 all\\xa0 the\\xa0basic\\xa0blockchain\\xa0functions\\xa0including\\xa0simple\\xa0tools\\xa0for\\xa0players\\xa0to\\xa0 create\\xa0their\\xa0own\\xa0buy\\xadin\\xa0games,\\xa0organize\\xa0and\\xa0host\\xa0multi\\xadplayer\\xa0tournaments,\\xa0and\\xa0buy,\\xa0sell\\xa0and\\xa0 create\\xa0tokens.\\xa0It\\xa0will\\xa0also\\xa0support\\xa0live\\xa0gameplay\\xa0for\\xa0all\\xa0on\\xadchain\\xa0games.\\xa0The\\xa0user\\xa0interface\\xa0will\\xa0 be\\xa0translated\\xa0into\\xa0several\\xa0languages,\\xa0and\\xa0will\\xa0have\\xa0a\\xa0modified\\xa0BSD\\xa0licence\\xa0for\\xa0both\\xa0personal\\xa0 and\\xa0commercial\\xa0use.\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\nTrustless Asset Exchange \\nAs a Graphene Blockchain, Peerplays has the same asset creation and exchange features as BitShares,\\u200b9 \\n\\u200benabling \\nusers to create their own tokens, and place buy and sell orders on the internal market which are filled by the on chain order matching smart contract. They can also transfer, buy and sell gateway tokens for popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH and price-stable \\u200bSmartCoins from the BitShares platform from a growing number of reputable gateway services. Players can even provide their own profitable gateway services by buying and selling in-game assets for popular RPGs. \\nWagering \\nThe Peerplays tournament smart contract accepts any user issued token for wagering, but charges a small fee if the tokens are not one of the \\u200bcertified wagering instruments\\u200b. These instruments are chosen in accordance with standards of acceptable value as determined by the committee. Certified instruments charge a \\u200brake fee in place of the standard registration fee, which is automatically distributed as part of the profit sharing program. Users can also place wagers with the Peerplays core token. \\nHosted (Public) Client Portals \\nHosted client portals are a way for users to access the Peerplays blockchain through their web browser,\\u200b10 while their private keys are stored locally. They are more convenient than private desktop clients, but like most cryptocurrency wallets they require backups to prevent \\n\\n========10========\\n\\naccidental loss of funds. P\\u200brivate desktop client portals operate much like lightweight wallets that do not require the user to download a full node, but instead reference a series of trusted public nodes. For the highest level of security, users can also run their own full node in conjunction with the desktop client. \\nOperating a public hosted client portal is an opportunity for businesses to make extra income through the referral program or by building and connecting an independent 3rd party website to organize and host their own server-side tournaments. \\nServer-Side Tournament Hosting \\nServer-side game hosting is still a trusted and proven model in the eSports industry, and has seen explosive growth in the past 5 years. Peerplays supports optional server-side hosting of games while offering a variety of tools for business enhancement. For example, s\\u200bimply connecting to Peerplays through the API allows anyone to utilize the decentralized network for processing of wagers and jackpots w\\u200bhile continuing to operate an independent website. Peerplays’ customizable tournament management smart contract lets any game publisher, advertiser, tournament host or vendor create their own t\\u200bournament structures, fee schedules, and wager collection & distribution methods for any off-chain (server hosted) game in the world. And \\u200bgaming partners can offer additional benefits and perks to users by designing their own custom GUI or even by simply hosting the basic open-source Peerplays GUI on a public server. \\nPeerplays also has a blockchain guaranteed referral program which automatically p\\u200bays a percentage of lifetime revenue for each new player referred to the network, which means businesses can earn major “kickbacks” b\\u200by plugging into Peerplays and getting all their existing users to sign up for a Peerplays account. \\nConclusion \\nPeerplays offers a unique value proposition to both end users and existing businesses. By combining provably fair gaming with a decentralized blockchain-based wagering, Peerplays effectively tackles several key industry challenges while offering strong incentives for existing gaming platforms to integrate. Overall, the platform is well equipped for future growth and adaptation to changing market conditions due to its next-generation voting and consensus mechanisms, and is strongly positioned to become the premiere go-to provider for blockchain based solutions in the online gaming industry. \\n\\n========11========\\n\\nReferences\\xa0 \\n[1] h\\u200bttp://www.pokersites.com/defunct\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n[2]\\xa0h\\u200bttp://www.gamblingsites.com/online\\xadgambling\\xadjurisdictions/\\xa0 \\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n[3]\\xa0h\\u200bttps://bitshares.org/blog/2015/06/08/measuring\\xadperformance/\\xa0 \\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n[4]\\xa0h\\u200bttp://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n[5]\\xa0h\\u200bttps://bitshares.org/zh/technology/high\\xadperformance\\xadand\\xadscalability/\\xa0 \\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n[6]\\xa0\\u200bhttp://docs.bitshares.org/bitshares/user/dex.html\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n[7]\\xa0\\u200bhttps://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,18684.0.html\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n[8]\\xa0\\u200bhttps://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip\\xad0007.md\\xa0 \\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n[9]\\xa0\\u200bhttps://docs.bitshares.org/bitshares/user/assets.html\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n[10]\\xa0\\u200bhttps://github.com/bitshares/web_wallet\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n\\xa0 \\n\\n========12========\\n\\n'"

       "'   Oct       hack ether camp  Virtual Accelerator  Abstract  Our goal is to create the ideal innovation environment for startups by  utilising blockchain technology for the release of the Virtual Accelerator       Introduction     If you look at history  innovation doesn t come  just from giving people incentives  it comes  from creating environments where their ideas  can connect      Steven Johnson  Year       Satoshi Nakamoto started the Bitcoin project  Nakamoto        This frst  blockchain made possible a completely autonomous fnance system   Year       a team of blockchain enthusiasts started project Ethereum  a revolutionary  technology making it possible to create essentially any type of autonomously directed  blockchain based object   Year       we are starting the Virtual Accelerator  VA  to provide transparent and true  acceleration to blockchain developers around the world   The technology of blockchain and smart contracts allows for transparent evaluation  and ranking via tokens that allow holders to refect their conviction for an idea for  development   Crowdfunding projects have become a popular method to raise funding at the early  stages of a project  Massolution          but generally the early backers don t receive  anything more than the frst version of the product   A better approach is to enable those that identify the value in an initiative at the  beginning to evidence their conviction using units of uniform value  That s what our  platform facilitates   The rights of early adopters who support an idea and project at the initial stages are  enforced by the Solidity  Reitwiessner       smart contract deployed to the Ethereum  blockchain    ether camp       Ideas     If you can dream it   you can do it       Walt Disney  The seed of each successful company begins with an idea  The idea requires a team  of people to turn it into a prototype or MVP  A prototype needs user input from early  adopters to iterate and improve it until users are actually willing to pay for the features  they want  This is the path followed by many startups as they have become today s  successful companies  The chain of success always starts with  an initial link of an  idea   The Virtual Accelerator registration opens months before the start of the event and we  encourage hackers to share their ideas publicly  A well explained idea is the best way  to get other people passionate and ask to join your team    ether camp       Hackers   Every child is an artist  The problem is how to  remain an artist once we grow up      Pablo Picasso  The Virtual Accelerator is a platform that allows for the presentation  testing and  launch of ideas  It s a place that fosters new startups   The frst step is to build a team  We encourage people to use the platform to fnd  teammates based on mutual interests  shared values and complementary skill sets   Once a team is in place  and the vision for the project is clear  the next step is to attract  early adopters  These are people who will try out the prototype  express interest in the  product and commit to the future roadmap   Attracting early adopters is important as it proves to the development team that  they re on the right track   What s unique about the  hack ether camp  platform is that early adopters can also  be turned into kickstart backers and fund the project using the tokenizing feature  available  to each startup team   See Early Adopters section for more   The platform provides an open stage for teams to display and share their work   allowing the whole community to see how they re progressing while getting honest  feedback from a panel of experienced judges on their progress and direction    ether camp       Judges      The more original a discovery  the more   obvious it seems afterwards      Arthur Koestler  As the event provides the potential for great ideas and projects to fourish and  materialise  we have invited a broad range of judges from various industries and  disciplines to provide feedback and direction to the teams   The judges are there to help provide the teams with motivation  with their votes  indicating that a team is making the right decisions      Each judge has a total of      kudos which they can award across various teams   Voting will commence one week after the event has started      Regular fans also have the right to vote and are provided with    kudos to issue to  the team or teams they see with the most potential   Fans can also increase the amount of kudos they have by providing proof of their  identity via their Facebook and   or Twitter account      additional kudos votes are  provided for each account added  Overall a fan can therefore have a total of      kudos      Voting on the blockchain is supported by a smart contract ProjectKudos and  described in details in the  Smart Contract Description  appendix    ether camp       Hacker Gold   Money never starts an idea  it is the idea that  starts the money      William J  Cameron  Hacker Gold  HKG  is the offcial token of the Virtual Accelerator  HKG allows anyone  to be involved and signify their appreciation of the best projects participating in the  event   HKG allows you to acquire tokens initiated by the individual startups during the  incubation period of the hackathon  Having these tokens  in turn  provides you with  preferred voting rights on the way that funds are used to develop the applicable  startup s idea  Startups  tokens issued after the hackathon do not come with preferred  voting rights   The amount of HKG collected by an individual team is a de facto crowd expression  of the perceived potential of the project  As such  it provides a baseline for future  crowdfunding by the team once the hackathon is over  The teams who collect the  most HKG will have the largest acceptance by the crowd and will have a clear signal of  the strength of their potential      For the duration of the hackathon tokens initiated by startups will be listed on the  virtual exchange that forms part of the  hack ether camp  platform and can be  purchased using HKG   The only way to gain preferred voting rights on a startup s development is to buy  tokens initiated by that startup during the hackathon event      The emission process  HKG will be available for   weeks  starting from   weeks  before the hackathon starts and ending after the   weeks of the event are  complete    ether camp       Hacker Gold  The price during the emission will be calculated like this      P    Week           HKG  for   Ether      P    Week           HKG       HKG  for   Ether    The actual formula when X is the day in P            X         HKG for   Ether        P    Week           HKG  for   Ether      P    Week           HKG       HKG  for    Ether    The actual formula when X is the day in P            X         HKG for   Ether  No Premine   There is no special amount reserved for anyone     No Second Emission   HKG will only be available for purchase one time  closing at the end of the second  hackathon  December       event  There will be no second sale  When the Virtual  Accelerator opens to new entrants through future hackathons the only way to  purchase HKG will be on the open market    ether camp       Hacker Gold  HKG trading on exchanges   HKG is expected to be available for open trading on leading altcoin exchanges after  the  hack ether  camp  event ends   Collected coins    The HKG token will refect the success of the Virtual Accelerator  with the ongoing  success of the platform in identifying breakout development teams and ideas  increasing the desire of developer and fans to hold the HKG token   The Virtual Accelerator platform presented at the time of releasing the white paper is  the  nd generation version  the  st generation version of the hackathon platform can  be seen here   http   season   ether camp   The Future   Development on the Virtual Accelerator platform will be ongoing with updated  versions being released periodically  Our goal is to scale the platform and have  frequent competitions  generating more ideas  establishing new teams and forming  new startups   Our mission is to democratise opportunity for everyone  from opening access to  entrepreneurs to early funding for development through to providing a way for  developers and fans in the community to support other startups  ideas   The ongoing development and marketing of the Virtual Accelerator will be funded from  the sale of HKG    ether camp       BlockChain  Presence   It s really hard to design products by focus  groups   A lot of times  people don t know what  they want until you show it to them       Steve Jobs  The team involved in each startup will have a self enforcing smart contract that will  guarantee the rights of each person that acquires the tokens initiated by the startup   This is achieved via the DSTContract  where DST stands for Decentralised Startup  Team   In this section we will provide an overview of the different aspects of the contract  for  the technical description please refer to the  Smart Contracts Description  appendix   Token offer  The startup is an group of developers looking to fund their project s R D activities   A fundamental aspect of the contract is holding the actual funds collected from the  community  There are   stages of fund collection      Offering tokens during the period of the hackathon  The DST will receive the HKG  token in exchange for the particular token a team is offering      After the hackathon event is over  The DST can receive Ether in exchange for the  particular token a team is offering   You will fnd more on the tokens value and rest of the funding discussed in  Post  Accelerator Period     ether camp       BlockChain  Presence  Executive Team  This is the core startup team  who have come together to implement an idea that  they all believe in  Teams will vary depending on what they are trying to achieve  but  generally it will be a mix of skills e g  a lead programmer  UI designer and system  administrator  would be a classic team that could build any prototype for a software  project   The primary obligation of the team is to drive forward the implementation of the  project  An important factor in this is how to allocate funds to make tangible progress   Whether the executive team is one person or more  to move the startup forward it  will need to propose how it uses its funds  The ability to do this lies solely with the  executive team as it is responsible for the success or failure of the project   Early Adopters  The adopters are more than just the people who test the initial versions of a product   they re actually real world validation that the project will have users  The valuable  contribution of early adopters is rewarded by providing them with voting rights    ether camp        BlockChain  Presence  Voting rights  Creating a balance between the right of early adopters to infuence the direction of a  startup  against the agility of the executive team to make funding decisions is key  To  allow for this  early adopters will not be asked to approve a proposal but only to refuse  a proposal they object to   If the executive team presents a proposal to spend X  of the funds  the funds will be  made available after    days unless     of the votes held by the early adopters object  to the transfer of the funds from the DSTContract       Impeachment process   In extreme cases if Early Adopters are not completely happy with what the executive  team is doing they can vote to change the executive team personnel  An impeachment  requires     of the voter rights   The most likely use case in this instance is to return funds  They can appoint a person  who will be responsible for returning the funds according to the share of each involved  person    ether camp        Post Accelerator  Period    The three great essentials to achieve anything  worthwhile are  frst  hard work  second  stick  to itiveness  third  common sense      Thomas A  Edison     After the incubation period of the event  the startups continue to evolve their  prototype product into a functioning business by developing more features and  presenting the user base with a product roadmap      It s important to state that  ether camp  is not claiming any rights over the  startups coming out from the Virtual Accelerator  The blockchain presence of the  startups is completely under the control of their executive team      The startup will be allowed to initiate  X more tokens immediately after the event  is over  Where X is the number of tokens sold during the hackathon event  The  tokens will be available to the general public directly for Ether  Tokens purchased in  the second phase of the crowdfund will not come with preferred voting rights      The voting rights that early adopters have been given for HKG tokens acquired  during the Virtual

DECENTRALIZED LOTTERY BASED ON ETHEREUM SMART CONTRACTS  This document describes the technical implementation of a system  based on smart contracts and important aspects regarding the  promotion and market launch of the system  KIBO Whitepaper         INTRODUCTION  Today  lottery is the largest social and entertainment game in the world  The share  of lotteries on the world s gambling market is over       The annual turnover of  this market today is      billion  Along with the penetration of the Internet and  the growing number of devices connected to a network  the number of users who  prefer playing this game online is growing  Consequently  the online lottery market  today is promising area    But despite such popularity  the lotteries currently present on the market cannot  provide the user with a       guarantee of an honest lottery or offer full transparen  cy with regard to the formation and distribution of the prize fund  It is not surprising  that this issue is a hot topic for discussion on forums and in private conversations  among amateurs who like try their fortune in this game  Unfortunately  at present  one can see licensed operators periodically caught in various sorts of violations re  garding prize fund distribution and the honesty of the lottery  Just as important are  the conditions for receiving awards  which also have a number of shortcomings in  the form of delayed payments and various kinds of commissions   Now  thanks to smart contracts  we have the ability to address these critical issues   KIBO is a decentralized lottery  the main advantage of which is the complete trans  parency of all processes taking place on the platform and the fundamental absence  of opportunities for fraud  Unlike  fair play checks   which allow one to check game  results in existing cryptocurrency lotteries  KIBO itself eliminates the potential for  fraud  This is made possible by Ethereum and the concept of smart contracts  The  marketing component of the lottery is also implemented based on smart contracts   allowing franchise partners and owners of KIBIT tokens to be sure of receiving their  earnings and the correctness of its calculation    KIBO is a platform where all processes are implemented and managed by smart  contracts  Ticket purchase  random number generation  and prize payouts  as well  as accruals in the distributed partner network  are performed by a smart contract  without the possibility of intervention by third parties    Changes in the platform are  made by a vote of control token holders  KIBO Whitepaper          ETHEREUM AS THE BASIS FOR IMPLEMENTATION  For implementation of the project  the Ethereum     decentralized network  which  uses the concept of  smart contracts   was chosen  Ethereum has great potential  for scaling     and the broad support of the cryptocommunity and investors  Cur  rently  the network is theoretically capable of handling about    transactions per  second  this is enough to start project implementation   Methods for network scaling presented in the above mentioned report     will make  it possible to accept more than    million users in the near future   KIBO Whitepaper             The KIBO framework  Currently  Ethereum infrastructure cannot yet offer a complete solution which in  cludes the decentralized part of the interface  the required functionality will appear  at the Metropolis stage  An excerpt from Ethereum s offcial blog       As it is not yet possible to decentralize the application interface itself at the mo  ment  the KIBO project is implemented partially in a server infrastructure which con  tains standard solutions for such cases  as well as a specialized application based  on smart contracts  In parallel with the work on the server solution  we are working  on various options for decentralizing the interface part  including our own solution   KIBO Whitepaper             The contract scheme   The KIBO Ethereum infrastructure is a set of contracts which interact with each  other according to the scheme below   At the initial stages of the platform s work  contracts in the system can be replaced   by the voting of control tokens  which at this stage are in the team of KIBO devel  opers   Upon completion of the test and development stages  the relations between  contracts will be recorded and subsequent changes in contracts and their relation  ships will not be possible   A  Managing contract  The contract which coordinates the interaction of all other KIBO contracts  such  as lotteries or voting contracts  New user registration  lottery ticket purchases and  implementation of decisions adopted in a voting contract are performed by means  of referencing the managing contract   KIBO Whitepaper          B  Repository   repository contract is used to store data about users  franchisee partners and their  relationships  It should be noted that the contract only stores anonymous data that  are not linked to the user s identity  the user is defned by his her alias and wallet    so any system user can be completely anonymous   Modifcation of certain data in the repository is only possible from the managing  contract  the central contract address is determined by voting of control token hold  ers   struct K Users User    uint shareholder   uint big   uint small   uint partner type   string username   uint    partner parents   uint    partner parents level   uint    player parents   uint    player parents level            if user is shareholder      amount of kibits   user     if user is partner         new      registered before platform start    login     parents partners structure for   levels    user have  q  partners at level of       parents players structure for   levels    user have  q  players at level of    C  Voting contract  A contract that stores a list of issues for the management of all contracts  as well as  the conditions for making decisions on these issues  The voting and decision mak  ing system is implemented such as to allow the development of the platform and  the addition of new games to KIBO s functionality without the possibility of interven  tion in the algorithms for accrual and work with the customer base of the separate  branch of each partner  Only control token holders have the right to vote in this  contract   struct K Ballot Type    string theme   uint quorum   uint need   uint length          issue text      quorum for decision making as a         for decision making     voting duration  seconds   KIBO Whitepaper             Contract management  Contract management is carried out by voting of control token holders  The list of  issues and the decision making conditions for each of them is initially set in the  contract  Any control token holder can initiate voting on any issue in the list and  vote   Voting results are accepted in the case of a positive vote of      to      of  control token holders  depending on the importance and impact on the subsequent  development and operation of the KIBO platform of the issue put to vote   To further stimulate voting activity  the following mechanism has been implement  ed  accrual of remuneration per token upon voting is carried out immediately after a  control token holder votes  The amount of remuneration for all        tokens is      of turnover from all platform lotteries   When tickets are purchased  funds are distributed as follows  Branch bonus       Payout on KIBITS       Lottery prize fund       Payout on control tokens      KIBO Whitepaper          Payout for the KIBO  PLATFORM franchisee   branch network        For payout of bonus  es for the line by line  branch network       distributed upwards        per level   Payout on KIBIT   tokens         Deferred payout on   control tokens       Prize fund formation            Tokens  The KIBO platform has several different types of tokens  each of which has its own  set of features and an expanded incentive system  All Payouts and accruals of re  muneration in the branch network and all types of tokens are triggered when tickets  are purchased  this is the most frequent action in the system   Payouts of prizes to  players are also triggered by this and in one more way described below in the  Pay  out  section  All platform tokens are not KIBO internal currency and are not intended  for internal settlements in the system  All payouts and remunerations are made  directly to the user s wallet in ETH cryptocurrency   KIBO control token         units are intended for contract management  It allows  one to put issues to a vote  voting contract  or vote on an issue  To further stimulate  voting activity       in ETH cryptocurrency  from the total turnover of all lotteries  connected to the KIBO system is accrued to all        tokens  Accrual of remu  neration takes place at all times  however  the actual payout to the user s wallet is  carried out only at the moment a control token holder votes  Thus  we strengthen  the motivation to vote  even for minority holders of control tokens   At the initial stage  control tokens will be distributed among the managing partners   In the future  all or part of the control tokens may be distributed among a large num  ber of partners interested in the project s development and growth  These are major  holders of KIBIT tokens or owners of platforms with large client bases   KIBO Whitepaper          This mechanism is incorporated in the smart contract algorithm in order to transfer  contract management to a decentralized basis in the future   KIBIT token   The KIBO platform s main investment asset  There are a total of      million tokens  to which      of total turnover from all platform lotteries is accrued    As part of the marketing strategy  at the crowd sale stage     million KIBIT tokens  will be distributed  to which     of turnover will be allocated  The remaining     mil  lion are owned by the development team and will form the company s income and  will be used at the team s discretion  including for further platform development   options within the team  and other strategic decisions    Tokens not sold during the sale remain under the control of the managing partners   Income generated by these tokens may be  sent to a specifc address by voting   KIBO PLATFORM token   Allows one to become a KIBO branch owner and receive  the  respective  bonus  for  the  expansion  of  the  client  network  and  building  of  a  branch  network   All  operations  and  payouts  of  remuneration  in  the  operation  of  KIBO branches are guaranteed by a smart contract  There a total of        base   Kibo Platform  tokens  The branch owner receives      from all tickets purchased by clients invited by him    levels deep  KIBO Whitepaper          Also   the  KIBO  platform s  functionality  incorporates  the  possibility  of  expanding  one s own branch network by sending registration links and platform recommen  dations  at  the  time  of  the  crowdsale   When  there  are  such  networks   additional  accruals from each of these platforms will be      from the income of all partner  branches up to the  th level   Thus       will be paid out from the purchase of each ticket to stimulate the devel  opment of the client network and branch network       from ticket sales is paid out  to the client base owner  and     is allocated among   levels upwards      each  for  payout to higher branches  which is equal to      of the partner s income at each  level    KIBO Whitepaper              Integrated marketing tool to promote continuous  platform growth  The user can participate in promotions and draws which are present on the KIBO  LOTTO platform  Any player can invite other players to the platform using his own  link and receive     of the invited players  winnings on a constant basis  This mech  anism is also managed by a smart contract and is part of a marketing strategy  called  game with friends   Receipt of winnings from a game with friends is gov  erned by the following rules   To receive     of the winnings of invited players    At level   you must have bought   ticket for this draw  At level   you must have bought   tickets for this draw At level   you must have bought   tickets for this draw  Thus  the player is interested in inviting other players  because  every invited person will greatly increase the chances of winning in each draw    Promotion  An important marketing component embedded in the KIBO platform smart con  tract is the proper motivation of each client at all levels of development  both for  ordinary users and for the platform owners    In the promotional draws  which will continue for three months after the platform  launch  everyone can take part in a series of free draws with large cash prizes  This  promotion is aimed at expanding the client base of each branch and KIBO LOTTO  as a whole  Each player  as part of this promotion  will be able to give his friends the  opportunity to participate in this series of draws  The free tickets received by a play  er as a gift win only if   numbers are matched  As in the  Game with friends  mecha  nism  if a player at one of the three levels below another player wins  the latter player  receives     of the amount won by the former player   To obtain this bonus  it is not  necessary to buy tickets  the player needs only activate his free tickets for this draw    KIBO Whitepaper           Free ticket activation and protection against bots   To reduce the risk of possible bot attacks during free draws  free ticket activation  for a new player is carried out through balance refll in an amount of    or more   After that  a restriction on cash withdrawal is set and funds in the amount of     cannot be withdrawn  but are at the user s disposal  They are available for purchase  of tickets for participation in any paid draws that are held on the platform along with  the promotions  The user can withdraw any amount above    at any time  Once this  account has purchased   tickets on the platform  the restriction is automatically  removed  and from that point on the user can withdraw all the funds and zero out  the balance   Thus  a bot attack becomes very costly and is comparable to simple  participation in the lottery  but for larger amounts   Prize fund formation and distribution        of a ticket purchase is allocated to prize fund formation    Comments   Since we have tickets from which payouts for the partner and client  bonus do not come entirely  as they fall within the area of non distribution  there is  always a remainder  This remainder is always used to replenish the current draw  prize fund  This means that in fact the percentage used for prize fund formation is  different each time and is always greater than       Let us take the initial      as  the basis for the description  These funds are intended for payouts related to the  lottery and distributed according to the reserve funds system within the contract as  follows  KIBO Whitepaper               are deposited to the  reserve fund   from which a guaranteed minimum jackpot  is formed for the next draw  if a jackpot is to be awarded in the current draw            are used for the formation of a fund from which     are paid three levels  upwards if a player with players above that invited him wins  Part of these funds will  not be spent each time after draw completion  For example  if a player who has only  one player above him wins  In this case       will not be paid to anyone  After each  draw  the unclaimed remainder from this fund is automatically sent to the  reserve  fund  of this lottery           are used for the formation of the prize fund  from which the jackpot and oth   er prizes are formed   Next    of the   lotteries presented on the platform at launch are  described as an example   Lottery              of funds received for the formation of the prize payout fund in the lottery       are allocated as follows   First of all       goes towards jackpot formation  By directing the funds from a  purchased ticket to increase the jackpot frst of all  we always know the jackpot size  even before the draw and we can refect its increase in proportion with ticket sales   Other prizes are formed after draw completion from the remaining      as follows     Fixed prizes are calculated frst   Tickets that guessed   main balls are frst  These players receive a prize in  an amount equal to the ticket price   Next  those who guessed   main balls   bonus ball receive their payout  The  amount of the payout is     times the ticket price   Next  those who guessed   main balls receive their payout  The amount of  the payout is   times the ticket price   The remaining funds are allocated among those who guessed   numbers or more  in the following order     main balls         main balls   bonus ball        main balls       KIBO Whitepaper           For example     players guessed   balls       is allocated among them in equal  shares   Jackpot increase  If in the current draw the jackpot is not won  the jackpot funds        go to increase  the next jackpot  That is  we take the      and add them to the amount that is  allocated for the jackpot from the ticket sales for the next draw  Thus  the jackpot  continues to grow until it is won  Once the jackpot is won  the contract accesses  the reserve fund and withdraws the amount for the minimum guaranteed jackpot   which increases from ticket sales according to the same scheme    General points    A lottery contract is intended for conducting a lottery and storage of its draw results  Only the last   draws   the current draw are stored   To generate random numbers  a combination of several factors is used   Every time a ticket is purchased  the user transmits a random set of data    automatically generated by frontend by default   After completion of the draw  the contract takes hashes of every other block  out of the    blocks after draw completion and mixes them with the ran  dom data from users   KIBO Whitepaper

number generation is similar to that for lottery       The lottery scheme is  also identical to that for lottery       KIBO Whitepaper              Payout of winnings  Due to the technical limitations of the ETHEREUM network at the moment  payouts  of winnings are made at the user s request  a click on the button in the user inter  face next to the corresponding draw    Due to the fact that in order to make the payout  a large number of records in the  contract must be sorted  since payouts on some matches are made as a percent  age  that is  they depend on the number of people who guessed the given combina  tion   the payout is not made immediately  but only after sorting all the necessary  data   For one user s payout request      tickets are sorted  after all the tickets have been  sorted   the actual payout to all users is launched by clicking the  payout  button       payouts per click   Payouts are made only to those users who have clicked the   payout  button    Thus  in order to complete sorting and payouts on all the tickets  one out of ffty  users who purchased a ticket needs to take his winnings  As the Ethereum network  scales up  the number of tickets sorted in a single operation will increase   KIBO Whitepaper              Conclusion  This document presents a part of the technological and marketing solutions that  are planned in the process of the KIBO platform s development  Also  as the Ethe  reum blockchain improves  we will actively use emerging network capabilities that  will make KIBO the most reliable and extensive decentralized lottery in the world   and will provide an opportunity to all those who joined the platform at the starting  period to share our success       Roadmap  The launch of the KIBO platform will take place in the

 well established  business  model  of  shared  workspaces   the  Primalbase  project  transforms  traditional  office  rental  into  a  new generation  community based ecosystem where one can share  sell or  rent  out  high quality  office  spaces  using  Ethereum  and  Waves based  digital  tokens  Primalbase  tokens  not  only  serve  a  practical  function   but  also  have  actual  inherent  value based on a real physical product  it is this that makes  Primalbase stand out from other projects utilizing crypto  tokens  The conception of the project and its core elements  are outlined in this paper      Introduction  Real  estate  is  one  of  the  most  conservative  areas  of  the  economy   while  Blockchain  is  considered  a  disruptive  and  novel  technology   Nevertheless   combining these seemingly incompatible elements has proved extremely fruitful    a salient example being WeWork    The foundation of most co working projects is the concept of creating a shared  infrastructure with a global community  The advantages of this business model  over  the  management  practices  of  large  corporations   with  their  rigid  internal  regulations  and  strict  hierarchy   are  quite  apparent   This  is  especially  true  for  young  technological  start ups   who  are  increasingly  rejecting  the  traditional  office set up in favour of co working environments  This format has gained much  traction   according  to        Global  Coworking  Survey   the  number  of  new  coworking  projects  has  roughly  doubled  since         and  the  number  of  their  residents is estimated at     million  see also fig           Fig     Basic coworking spaces statistics  from Global Coworking survey       The number of successful co working projects   most notably WeWork  Spaces  and Second Home   evidences the vitality and potential of this business model   According to         the creative hub is more than the sum of its parts  It offers  creative micro businesses the chance to aggregate with others in order to access  crucial resources such as tools  specialist services  or inspiration to help develop  projects  and  businesses   Hubs  represent  a  collective  approach  to  coping  with  uncertain social  cultural and economic environments and processes of creativity  and  innovation     Our  research  shows  that  creative  hubs  can  produce  a  wide  range  of  impacts  including  start up  ventures   jobs   new  products  and  services   future  investment   public  and  commercial    talent  development   regional  talent  retention   informal  education  and  engagement   training   urban  regeneration   research  and  development   new  networks   innovative  models  of  organization   quality of life enhancements and resilience    We  believe  that  the  use  of  crypto tokens will  both  benefit  and  enhance  this  model  it was this notion that inspired the creation of this project  Through the  use of a single payment crypto token membership  the Primalbase project offers  access  to  all inclusive  shared  workspaces  located  in  the  world s  leading  tech  hubs  It s scalable  fast to set up  and flexible in terms of timing and the size of  the team   The rest of the paper is organized as follows  The first section will outline the  basic  concept  of  the  project  and  summarize  its  core  components   The  second  section  is  devoted  to  explaining  the  token  system   their  purpose   the  pricing  mechanism and the transfer of ownership  The rules of the initial coin offering   ICO   campaign  will  also  be  charted  in  this  section   The  legal  aspects  and  limitations  associated  with  this  project  will  be  discussed  in  the  final  sections   Appendix  A  provides  a  summary  of  the  stack  of  Blockchain  technologies  that  will play a key role in the operation of the project  The accompanying software  architecture is schematically described in Appendix B          Concept  The  project  will  be  executed  in  two  main  stages   The  first  stage  is  the  establishment  of  five  shared  workspaces  in  the  following  strategic  locations   Amsterdam  Berlin  London  New York and Singapore  Strategic in that  each is  regarded as one of the most beneficial cities for tech entrepreneurs  These spaces  will  be  up  to        square  meters  in  size   The  locations  of  future  Primalbase  workspaces will be decided by the vote of the Primalbase token holders  see also  paragraph        A  system  of  dividing  the  infrastructure  into  rentable  offices   based  on  classic   standard real estate relations  and non rentable co working spaces reserved only  for Primalbase community members  based on crypto economic relations   will  ensure efficiency and profitability of Primalbase business model  Non members  can obtain temporary membership and access to co working spaces through the  renting of tokens from Primalbase community members   Although  ultimately   the  underlying  profit  of  Primalbase  will  be  made  through  the renting of office space to companies  project teams  startups  branch offices   etc  This will cover the operating expenses of the property management company   The cryptocurrency token Primalbase  PBT  is built on the WAVES platform and  is  compatible  with  Ethereum  protocols   cf   appendix  B    There  is  a  proof of  concept up and running in Amsterdam  which is already receiving endorsements  from prominent international tech entrepreneurs who have become members of  Primalbase s  growing  community   In  accordance  with  the  business  model  outlined  above   the  Amsterdam  unit  provides  shared  workspaces  to  the  current  members of the Primalbase community   To  develop  and  run  more  Primalbase  units  we  need  to  collect  funds  that  will  cover  start up  costs   the  operating  expenses  of  the  Property  Management  Company   as  well  as  capital  expenditures   building  the  offices  with  shared  workspaces in selected locations   To accomplish this task  the ICO procedure is  necessary    The  funds  collected  through  ICO  will  allow  us to  begin  the  creation  of  Primalbase infrastructures  adjust the first five units to the level of cost recovery   and  ultimately  produce  the  revenue  to  be  re invested  in  building  the  next  locations  The value of the tokens will surge as the demand continues to rise   Additionally   the  tokenization  of  our  shared  workspaces  provides  us  with  a  unique  opportunity  to  establish  a  pool  of  committed  community  members   tenants  landlords and opinion leaders  who we can rely on in the future stages of  the project s development           Token system     Purpose and functionality  There are   main reasons for adopting the token system            It  is  a  means  of  raising  enough  money  to  develop  the  project   Well  implemented  crowd  sales   with  carefully  defined  objectives  and  guarantees  are one the best ways to both generate capital and to build a  community that has a stake in its success   The token represents a simple universal measure of the value of renting  membership from community members  the rising number of Primalbase  locations   efficiency  of  the  shared  workspaces  model   and  operating  profitability of the company   The  tokens  can  be  considered  as  an  investment  instrument  because  its  market value can significantly change as the project develops   To expand on that last point   opening hubs in new locations should lead to an  increase in our community membership  which in turn will allow us to establish  and secure new partnership agreements  The operating profit will also grow  as its  source is not the turnover of the tokens themselves  but the classical real estate  business model of subletting office space  This financial flow will enable us to  open several new hubs  which will lead to a further increase in the price of the  tokens   if only because each token will give access to an ever increasing office  infrastructure  This process is depicted schematically on the figure below   Fig     Diagram of token market price mechanics  We emphasize that the Primalbase team cannot guarantee a monotonic increase in  the price of tokens and is not responsible for the possible losses associated with  such  speculative  use  of  tokens   Access  to  all  Primalbase  hubs  services  and  functionality is guaranteed unconditionally on the current market price of a token           Token specification  One  PBT  token  allows  full  access  to  the  shared  workspace  at  any  Primalbase  location  for  one  person   In  every  office  space   all  the  necessary  services  and  amenities will be present and provided  such as broadband Internet access  digital  printing  etc  The term of the token is unlimited and  therefore  does not expire   The fee itself is secured in a single payment  The number of tokens that can be  purchased  by  the  same  holder  is  unlimited   In  this  case   the  possession  of     tokens permits the use of a private office  if one is available    As noted above  current tokens holders can participate in the further development  of the project  for example  to participate in the selection of future sites for new Primalbases  as decided by a general vote  Tokens are not bound to a person or  company  and anyone who can certify their ownership of it can use it  That is  the  token can be resold or leased on  see paragraph        PBT  tokens  are  divisible   i e   their  number  need  not  be  an  integer   Fractional  shares  are  introduced  for  the  convenience  of  working  with  PBT  as  investment  assets  The smallest fraction is        PBT  It is worth noting that to access the  services of the hub the holder must have at least one complete token   We  assume  that  all  participants  in  the  project  will  maintain  a  proper  level  of  decorum  decency and ethical conduct  Therefore  the team reserves the right to  revoke  membership   and  deny  access  to  Primalbase hubs  for  gross  or  repeated  violation of the rules of conduct  In this case  the current holder of the tokens can  only sell them   The  total  number  of  free to use  tokens  is  limited  to         Another       tokens  will be held in store for the social activities of the tech community  and will be at  the disposal of members of the advisory board    During the ICO  the payment can be made in any currency  both fiat and crypto   in the case of the latter  it will be possible to use third party conversion services  like Kraken or Shapeshift  On the first day of ICO price of PBT will be equal to    Bitcoins  BTC   and from the second to the seventh day of ICO   to   BTC   Starting from the eighth day the cost of the token will be   BTC    The  funds  raised  during  ICO  stage  will  be  kept  in  a  multi signature  wallet  supervised by three members of the Advisory board  Funds are transparent and  will  be  spent  according  to  the  long term  strategic  plan   see  also  sec        an  approximate breakdown of raised funds is depicted on fig    below    The ICO campaign will take place until the purchase of all      tokens  but for  no longer than   month  If  not all the tokens are sold by the end of this period   the unrealized balance will also be placed at the disposal of the board of directors   Operations with tokens  sale  leasing  etc   will be allowed only after the end of  the ICO campaign       Fig     Approximate breakdown of funds spending  As the project develops  part of the operating profit is expected to be spent on the  purchase  of  a  certain  number  of  tokens   This  will  allow  the  reinvestment  of  revenue into the further development of the project   specifically  the opening of  new  hubs   Moreover   these  measures  will  partly  help  preserve  the  liquidity  of  PBT tokens at a level sufficient to make them an attractive investment medium       Token ownership   Primalbase members  can  rent  or  sell  their  tokens  using  the  special  technical  feature of the underlying WAVES protocols  From a technical point of view  this  means that ownership of any amount of PBT can be transferred  temporarily or  permanently  These are peer to peer transactions  therefore  parties must agree on  costs and payments between themselves   The holder of the token is protected by his own Blockchain   the protocol works  in such a way that the token cannot be transferred on but remains in the wallet of  the rentee  in effect  the token is on a  temporary loan   The minimal duration  that a token can be rented is   months  and there is no maximum period  A rental  agreement may be terminated ahead of time by mutual decision of the parties or  unilaterally   Formally   the  WAVES  platform  does  not  allow  the  inclusion  of  specific leasing rules  i e  the price  time  conditions  etc   into the Blockchain  as  there can be too many scenarios of interaction between users  However  within  the leasing agreement between the parties  there are guarantees on the fulfillment  of contractual obligations of all involved   A token holder can sell as many tokens as they choose  However  any holder who  has  sold  all  their  tokens   loses  the  right  to  access  the  co working  services  provided  The innate features of Blockchain technologies make it impossible to  restore the ownership of tokens if the holder has  for whatever reason  lost his  private key  The responsibility to reliably store the private key is that of the token  holder alone           Legal aspects and issues  Due  to  the  retrospective  nature  of  regulatory  action   our  team  can  make  no  guarantees regarding the legality of the platform or launch of ICO campaign in  any given jurisdiction  PBT tokens are not securities and do not hold any rights in  the  company   We  must  operate  our  business  in  accordance  with  the  laws  of  relevant jurisdictions  As such  PBT tokens may not be immediately available in  certain countries   The advisory board protects investors  interests and provides the latter with all  the necessary reportage  The investor relations are built in a way like that of IPO    based on quarterly investment reports   All legal aspects of real estate transactions   including  but not limited to  the  management and negotiation of rental contracts  the maintenance and surveillance  of buildings  and tax payments   will be coordinated by a central management  unit in the UK      Future development  We intend to create larger scale and all encompassing hubs at the most suitable  locations   Developing  on  our  original  Primalbase  concept   we  will  create  more  extensive  all inclusive  venues  with  bars   restaurants   event  spaces  and  other  related facilities  A part of the profit made from these ventures will be distributed  among token holders   Based  on  business  tasks  and  received  feedback   we  can  enhance  token  functionality  and  add  new  features   The  modular  structure  of  chosen  digital  platform allows for further development and extension       Appendix A  Blockchain technologies  Ledgers have been at the heart of commerce since ancient times and are used to  record  many  things   most  commonly  assets  such  as  money  and  property   Blockchain technology relies on the concept of distributed digital ledgers  which  are  essentially  asset  databases  that  can  be  shared  across  a  network  of  multiple  sites or institutions  All participants within a network can have their own identical  copy of the ledger  Any changes to the ledger are reflected in all copies within  minutes  or in some cases  seconds   Distributed  ledgers  are  inherently  harder  to  attack   compared  to  traditional  centralized versions  Instead of a single database  there are multiple shared copies  of  the  same  database   so  a  cyber attack  would  have  to  attack  all  the  copies  simultaneously to be successful  The technology is also resistant to unauthorized  change or malicious tampering  as participants in the network would immediately  spot  a  change  to  any  part  of  the  ledger   Furthermore   the  method  by  which  information is secured and updated means that participants can share data and be  confident that all copies of the ledger at any one time match each other   Traditional ledgers achieve a level of privacy by limiting information access to  the parties involved and a trusted third party  By contrast  a Blockchain system is  transparent  all network participants can examine records in the ledger  Privacy  can still be maintained  however  by breaking the flow of information in another place    keeping  pseudonymous  public  keys   which  correspond  to  the  participants   The  network  can  see  that  a  transaction  occurred   but  uninvolved  parties lack the information to link the transaction with specific identities   In       Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin      the first implementation of a  protocol that enables the issuance of a digital bearer instrument without a trusted  third party  This was achieved through the use of the ledger replication system  i e   Blockchain   Bitcoin  solves  the  difficult  problem  of  implementing  decentralized  digital  cash   but  its  security  model  limits  its  efficiency  and  throughput  its design only supports a single native asset  and its virtual machine  offers  limited  support  to  custom  programs  that  determine  asset  movement   sometimes called smart contracts   Ethereum   which  launched  in         develops  the  concept  of  a  Blockchain  to  a  fully programmable state replication mechanism  While it includes a much more  powerful programming language  it presents additional challenges for scalability  and  efficiency   Its  general purpose  computation  model  makes  it  difficult  for  engineers to reason about security of their applications   For  further  information  interested  readers  are  referred  to  surveys           and  monographs             Appendix B  Application architecture  Fig     Schematics of Primalbase applications infrastructure  WAVES  protocols  and  routines  constitute  the  core  of  Primalbase digital  infrastructure and functionality  The advantages of using WAVES platform are   ease  of  custom  token  creation   low  cost  of  operations   built in  decentralized  exchange  and integrated work with fiat currencies  Most of the operations can be  performed without leaving the WAVES wallet  WAVES platform is compatible  and interoperable with Ethereum platform  as Ethereum is the renowned market  leader  and  popularly  used  in  crowd  sales   We  believe  that  in  the  future  all  the  Blockchain systems will be combined into one ecosystem  therefore  the WAVES  platform was chosen as the key element of Primalbase apps  WAVES is making  great  strides  towards  this  goal   which  will   naturally   increase  accessibility  and  create new opportunities        References      Creative Hubs  Understanding the New Economy  British

unwitting purchase of bot traffic in digital advertising markets defrauds advertisers of over       billion annually   Opaque supply chains provide cover for botnet operators who hide behind the black  boxes of exchanges and deep within unauditable ad networks   Because supply chain entities downstream  from the advertiser are generally paid on a cost per mille   CPM   basis  their incentive alignment is  towards maximizing impressions irrespective of whether those impressions are from human eyeballs or  bots  Because botting is cheap and hard to detect  it may even be economically rational for downstream  entities to knowingly serve ads to bots   Ad buyers are increasingly frustrated by having their money stolen   While programmatic ad buying is  undoubtedly the path forward for quantifying the value of ad buys relative to direct dealing and is the  highest growth area of digital advertising  programmatic is  at present  a morass for quantifying efficacy in  advertising non installable goods   The behaviors of humans on web pages are easily mimicked by bots  and the flagging of bot network signatures is essentially a cat and mouse game   This leaves advertisers  mostly powerless against the incentive structure of the downstream supply chain   The adChain  R egistry  i s a decentrally owned domain  w hitelist being  l aunched as  a  c ollaboration  of

of the registry by voting  ju diciously  to maintain  th is  v irtuous  c ycle   The adChain Registry  The adChain Registry is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain which stores domain names  accredited as non fraudulent by adToken holders  The presence of the domain foo net in the registry  means that adToken holders have recently assessed that domain belongs to a legitimate publisher with a  real human audience   The Registry also exposes both an interface with which token holders propose new domains to be listed   and one to challenge such proposals  An interface for token holders to vote on outcomes when challenges  are raised is also exposed       Ad Fraud Estimates Double   WPP  Business Insider  March                  The Methbot Operation   WhiteOps  Page

Recode  February                Mystery Shopping Inside the Ad Fraud Verification Bubble   Shailin Dhar  June           pg          Finally  an interface is exposed with which adToken holders can vote to reparameterize constant factors in  the Registry  such as the period over which listing applications are challengeable   Listing Applications and Data  To apply for listing in the adChain Registry  the applicant supplies a domain name such as foo net and an  adToken deposit  The application sits in an application pool for the duration of a challenge period  If no  challenges are raised against the application over the course of the challenge period  the domain is added  to the Registry   Listings in the adChain Registry are only valid for a finite period of time  Because domain names can be  sold or degrade in quality over time  a high quality domain today may be low quality tomorrow   Registrants can apply to renew a listing prior to the lapse of its accreditation  and a successful renewal will  cause no interruption to the domain s accreditation status  When a listing s accreditation lapses  the  adToken deposit made with the original listing application can be withdrawn by the applicant   Listings may include additional  optional metadata such as whether the registrant accepts BAT  payments or an attestation of compliance with tintr standards    Challenging Applications For Listing  Applications for apparently fraudulent or low quality domains will be challenged by rational adToken  holders  To initiate a challenge against a listing application during its challenge period  a token holder  must deposit a sum of adToken equal to the deposit made by the applicant  Doing so initiates a voting  period during which token holders engage in a token weighted vote which determines whether an  applicant is to be admitted  The voting scheme is commit reveal and derives from Colony s partial lock  token weighted voting system          Basic Attention Token  BAT    Brave Software  May            pg          If the challenge is settled in favor of the applicant  the challenger s deposit is forfeited and the applicant s  domain is listed in the adChain Registry  If the challenge is settled in favor of the challenger  the  applicant s deposit is forfeited and the applicant s domain is not listed in the adChain Registry  Applicants  can reapply for listing as often as they like if their application fails   When the vote concludes a percentage of the forfeited deposit is awarded directly to the winning party in  the challenge  either the applicant or the challenger  as a special dispensation  The remainder of the  deposit is divided proportionally among token voters in the winning bloc by token weight  Voters in the  losing bloc receive nothing    The deposit of the winning party in the challenge is always returned to them  Tokens locked for voting are  always returned to their owners regardless of whether they were cast with the majority or the minority   Only the deposit of the losing party in the challenge is redistributed and not recoverable by its original  owner   Parameterization of the Registry  There are no constant   magic number   values in the adChain Registry  The Registry will be instantiated  with reasonable values based on the best estimations of the creators  but all of these will be changeable by  adToken holders who may vote to reparameterize the Registry  Parameterized values mentioned so far  include  application deposit amounts  the duration of the challenge period  the duration of a registration s  validity  the duration of the commit and reveal periods in token votes and the size of the special  dispensation made to the winning party in token votes  Parameters of the governance system itself may be  votable as well  such as the share of tokens required to initiate a reparameterization   As an example of how the parameterization of constant values in the registry affects the mechanics of the  game  consider the special dispensation awarded to challenge winners  Rational actors should only   pg          challenge listing applications based on a calculation of potential earnings  which is a function of the  challenger s expected payout and confidence in winning the token vote  The challenger stands to lose       of their deposit if they lose the token vote  or win some amount over their original deposit if they  win the token vote  If the special dispensation is set at      a rational challenger must be above      confident in their ability to win a token vote to raise a challenge   Thus the percentage of the applicant s  deposit allocated as a special dispensation for the challenger determines the confidence level above which  a rational challenger will submit challenges   The adToken supply is non votable  and adToken can be neither minted nor destroyed  The                adToken deployed upon instantiation will be the set number of adToken in perpetuity   The Virtuous Incentive Structure Between Advertisers  Publishers and adToken Holders  Most payments  in  digital advertising  o ccur on  a  CPM basis  The CPM model creates misaligned  incentives  a nd  is  th e  s ource  o f many  is sues in the digital advertising supply chain  n advertiser pays a  publisher some fixed amount per thousand impressions and this constitutes a CPM  The problem with  the CPM model is that  i mpressions are an exceptionally weak  i ndicator of actual attention spending by  viewers  This is in part due to the fact that impressions are highly abstract notions which different  vendors assess in different ways  Vendors downstream from the advertiser are incentivized to assess what  constitutes an impression as loosely as possible    A malicious publisher in the advertiser to publisher example has no real incentive to report any page view  as less than a full impression  Indeed  because it is so easy for bots to impersonate human behavior on web  pages  it is often economically rational for a publisher to buy bot impressions and report them to the  advertiser as legitimate  The advertiser is incentivized to scrutinize the impression data they receive  carefully  but the task is essentially non computable and devolves to statistical guessing  This problem is  exacerbated by the large number of intermediaries in a typical programmatic supply chain  A single ad  impression can transact between dozens of parties that sit between the advertiser and the publisher  The incentive structure of the publisher is identical to all those parties downstream of the advertiser  since  anybody who reports fraud down the line forfeits revenue for themselves by doing so   The key innovation of the adChain Registry is that it incentivizes the curation of a reputable supply pool  by decoupling the incentives of the registry owners  adToken holders  from CPMs  Token holders have  one concern  which is to flag fraudulent and low quality applicants to the pool and win votes to reject  those applications  The simple schelling point for these votes is around whether the applicant is fraudulent  or low quality  voters acting rationally should settle in blocs for or against acceptance on the basis of their  assessment of those qualities  Voters who act rationally and perform good diligence will be rewarded  Less  diligent voters on the losing side incur opportunity cost without upside for having locked their adToken  uselessly over the duration of the voting period   A final point must be understood to close the loop on the virtuous incentive cycle between advertisers   publishers and token holders  A  meta  schelling point for voting behavior in challenges is not explicitly  whether the applicant is fraudulent or not  but what outcome in the vote will increase the value of      There is a     chance of       deposit and a     chance of      deposit                                pg          adToken  While this notion should be very tightly coupled to the notion of fraudulence  it is useful to  consider it in its own right   Consider that the challenge game is only available to play when there are applicants in the applicant pool   The applicant pool will only have applicants in it while publishers desire to make or renew listings in the  adChain Registry  Publishers will only desire to make or renew listings in the adChain Registry while  advertisers desire to service bid requests for ad space from publishers in that registry  Advertisers  in turn   will only desire to service bid requests for ad space from publishers in the adChain Registry while the  Registry is considered clean relative to other ad networks and whitelists  This being the case  token holders  are incentivized to keep the registry clean by initiating challenges against suspect applicants and voting to  remove apparently fraudulent listings   The game design of the adChain Registry  with its deposits and voting  has a lot in common with proof  of stake consensus in blockchains  The key difference is that blockchains verify blocks  which is  computable  while adChain verifies domains as non fraudulent  which is not  adChain thus explores the  general pattern of using collateralized consensus mechanisms to establish single sources of truth in non  computable domains  adChain does not aim to solve advertising fraud directly  it simply allows the  advertising industry to agree on what fraud is  and where to draw the line    Practical Utilization of the Registry  The adChain Registry provides a high quality  zero cost whitelist from which advertisers can read to  assess whether or not to service inbound bid requests on ad opportunities  The minimal contents of a  listing in the adChain Registry  however  are nothing more than a domain name and an indicator of the  listing s accreditation status  Assuming the absence of any authentication scheme  if foo net is an  accredited registrant in the adChain Registry a bot farm could trivially impersonate foo net by simply  changing the origin headers of their bid request messages   Advertisers need to protect themselves from the trivial attack in which bot farms impersonate adChain  registrants by spoofing origin headers  While the Registry itself is unopinionated on this matter  it will be  useful for the industry to settle on a uniform way of authenticating themselves to one another  The use of  bidirectional authentication using Transport Layer Security  TLS   a widely deployed and battle tested  suite of technologies  can address this  The unidirectional handshake protocols of TLS underpin  authentication for HTTPS connections on the Web  Bidirectional TLS handshakes underpin  authentication in the widely used SSH  Secure Shell  protocol   This section  a lso discusses  t ools  w hich  w ill  be  pr ovided by MetaX to  enable token  h olders  t o easily  interact with  th e  a dChain  R egistry  and  a  p artnership  w ith  D

dustry    pg          Mutual Authentication Using TLS  By pushing authentication out of the application layer and into a widely used transport layer technology  like TLS  adChain registrants can conduct ad commerce in RTB  VAST  VPAID or any other markup  format including ones which do not exist yet  It also means existing production ready software can be  leveraged to perform the authentication  and onboarding costs for new users become as low as a few lines  in a webserver config file   Bidirectional TLS authentication using certificate signing keys in the Web HTTPS regime will suffice to  authenticate users in adChain  An advertiser servicing a bid request with headers indicating an origin at  foo net will ask the sender to mutually authenticate in the TLS handshake  The recipient will expect  authentication to be performed with a key authenticable using an SSL certificate for foo net issued by a  trusted Certificate Authority   The advertiser s server implements the following branching logic      Can this client perform mutual authentication over TLS     If yes  did the client authenticate properly in the TLS handshake     If yes  does this domain have a listing in the adChain Registry   If the answer to any of those questions is  no   the server branches off to execute arbitrary logic to handle  that case  Supporting the authentication of adChain members does not mean advertisers must forgo  business with non adChain members   On the supply side  entities serving bid requests must be able to authenticate in TLS sessions using the  certificate signing key of the registrant whose domain listing they solicit bids for  Technically savvy  publishers may choose to simply run their own ad servers to retain control of their certificate signing keys   Most publishers  however  are used to working with vendors who solicit bids and return ad markup  without requiring they do anything more than embed Javascript on their webpage  Adopting mutual  authentication means vendors must either apply for a listing in the adChain Registry or interface with  publisher controlled signing servers   Rational token voters should be biased towards rejecting vendor applications because vendors aggregating  supply from multiple publishers are difficult to audit and can easily hide bot traffic amongst their  legitimate traffic  The signing server approach is likely a happy middle ground  deploying a signing server  should not be difficult even for relatively unsophisticated publishers who desire to retain control of their  certificate signing keys  and the task can be entrusted to specialized service providers as well   Another possibility is for publishers to simply entrust their certificate signing keys to proxies who work on  their behalf  Sharing a certificate signing key requires high trust in the proxy  but sophisticated vendors  may be able to build businesses using this model   pg          Interfaces for Voting  While the adChain

industry participants such as the DMA and their members orgs   a nd pay for legal  a nalyses  The pre sale of tokens  were to specifically identified participants who have an interest in seeing the adChain platform become a transformative  p rotocol  w ithin  th e advertising  te chnology  in dustry  The        o f pre sale tokens represent     million of  t he   billion tokens to be distributed at  t he public launch  contemplated to take place in late June         The token breakdown is as follows                million to be distributed in a public token sale with a cap of     million sold     million reserved for MetaX  per the time lock schedule detailed below      million reserved for ConsenSys  per the time lock schedule detailed below      million sold to fund development via multiple pre sale agreements  as described above   ConsenSys and MetaX will jointly deliver on the roadmap outlined in this white paper  It is the belief of  ConsenSys and MetaX that token launches in this ecosystem may be naive in selling upwards of      during their first  token round   Typical startups would exhibit an even greater failure rate if they limited  their startup capital to only one funding round  ConsenSys and MetaX believe it is better to sell tokens  over time as i  adChain achieves its targeted adoption milestones across the digital advertising industry  and ii  ConsenSys and MetaX continue to develop and release new advancements of the adChain  protocol  As such  ConsenSys and MetaX believe it is in the best interest of the platform to retain     of  the tokens after the first public sale  This gives the adChain team flexibility to initiate future token sales if  warranted    ConsenSys and MetaX plan to use part of the     retained tokens held in escrow as bounties for the  community to build specifically desired functionality  After year one when governance is more fully  fleshed out in the adChain protocol  ConsenSys and MetaX plan to post tokens in escrow and have token   pg           holders vote on whether or not submissions satisfy requirements of our bounties    this ensures that  ConsenSys and MetaX push further into decentralized control over the adChain system   To signal the level of commitment both ConsenSys and MetaX have for this system  each entity has  agreed to lock up all of their tokens with the following unlocking schedule            unlocked   year after public sale  Remaining tokens unlocked    months after public sale  Future Work In adChain  The adChain Registry and TLS authentication scheme proposed is production ready to support server  side header bidding  To conduct server side header bidding means a publisher or its proxy solicits bid  requests from the demand side directly  without an exchange acting as an intermediary  Server side  header bidding has been gaining traction in advertising technology independently of the rise of  blockchains because it provides bid transparency to publishers and removes a middleman from the  demand supply relationship   It works well with adChain because it is a peer to peer technology which  maps onto many of the design patterns becoming prevalent in the emerging field of cryptosystems  One  factor which has impeded the adoption of header bidding throughout the industry is the problem of   discovery   or identifying the entity on the other side of an inbound bid request  The adChain Registry is  a breakthrough for discovery in header bidding  as the bid request recipient can determine whether an  otherwise unknown entity is reputable simply by authenticating it over TLS and checking whether it has  an adChain listing   A long term objective is to bring the benefits of blockchains and the adChain Registry to users whose needs cannot be fully satisfied by server side header bidding  Enabling discovery for client side header  bidding will be highly desirable as the web decentralizes  and supporting authentication over multi hop  supply chains will be a breakthrough necessary for the construction of fully programmatic ad hoc supply  chains  Using blockchains and content addressed file systems to verify the delivery and display of ad  markup could eliminate an entire category of ad fraud  Strong attribution of identity linked actions is a  holy grail for programmatic web advertising potentially made possible by open identity systems such as  uPort   Discovery For Client  Side Header Bidding  Like server side header bidding  client side header bidding disintermediates exchanges and enables supply  to engage in ad commerce with demand directly and peer to peer  As the name implies  client side header  bidding requests originate in the browser rather than on a publisher controlled server  Because secrets  cannot be safely stored in browsers  authenticating supply when requests originate in the browser cannot  be done using bidirectional TLS  It may become feasible to utilize emerging client side signing standards  to construct something like an adChain user registry  or even do so as a function of open attestation         Envisioning The Future In A Server Side Header Bidding World   Rachel Parkin  AdExchanger  February            pg           mappings on an existing identity system  Rather than authenticate the publisher  it should be possible to  authenticate the user   Deep Supply Chain Auditing  The adChain Registry allows for advertisers to authenticate bid requesters as registrants in a clean pool of  supply in a direct  peer to peer manner  In practice  most ad exchange today is conducted over multi hop  supply chains  Our approach for authentication using mutual TLS is not useful for authentication  between entities in a supply chain which are not directly connected with one another  This is to say  one  can authenticate the individual they are speaking with  but not who that individual is speaking for in band  to bidirectional TLS itself   I am bar net  I am working for baz net who is working for foo net    To do so  will require novel application layer authentication logic involving diffs on ad markup and signature  bundling   Creative Verification  A registry could be used to allow adChain members to register hashes of individual creative assets and  metadata  The metadata could include the creative media type  its IAB Content Taxonomy   categorization and its dimensions  for example  This registry could be used to do proactive verification of  creative throughout the supply chain  or allow publishers to blacklist classes of ads by metadata   Tracker Tag Registry  A registry that allows analytics providers to register a hash of their javascript tracking tags  These tags are  used to track user engagement with advertisements on web pages  but are sometimes corrupted by hackers  and used as malware vectors to install ransomware on the computers of unsuspecting people surfing the  web  If the adChain community could enforce a vetting process for new tracker tags  and publishers could  verify tracking tags before running them  it would be harder to spread malware through advertising    Strong Attribution For Identity Linked Actions  A holy grail of web advertising technology is a demand centric attribution protocol with provable  performance metrics  When advertisers pay for performance rather than impressions  it no longer matters  whether an impression is a human or a bot  if the impression results in a purchase  the advertiser s  ultimate objective has been met   In general  attribution for actions in web advertising is low quality  It is very difficult to measure whether  a product was purchased as the result of the purchaser having viewed advertisements unless the purchase  happens in a click through  Even then  it remains difficult to attribute credit for that purchase to  advertisements for the same product the user may have viewed previously on different publisher sites   Advertisers simply do not know whether what they are doing really works  and publishers are disinclined  to provide such information because it is more profitable for them to bill by eyeballs than by performance   Cookie syncing and all the black magic of adtech on the web has not produced a good attribution  technology for the open web to date  Open identity systems running on blockchains have the potential to   pg           provide all the richness and assurance of data harvestable by closed social media platforms and finally  provide the kernel of persistence necessary for strong attributions on the open web   Advanced Voting and Governance Systems  adToken holders are able to participate directly in voting on applications for listing in the adChain  Registry  It will be desirable to empower adToken holders to safely delegate their votes to smart contracts  like Gnosis prediction markets  or to trusted representatives in a similar vein to proof of work mining pool  participation   Another direction to explore is time locking tokens used in voting  which has been discussed by Vitalik  Buterin and others    Time locking tokens used in voting could increase voter stake in the adChain  community beyond the tactical game of vote outcomes  because positions could only be exited over a  strategic timeframe   Impression Tracking   Beyond facilitating discovery for peer to peer header bidding  adChain can also be extended to function  as an accounting tool for near realtime impression tracking  For traditional ad contracts with    to    day  settlement cycles  discrepancies in impression reporting between parties are not discovered until the  contract is complete  Discrepancies in tracked impressions commonly reach up to        Some of these  are intrinsic to browsers and networks and come from latency  network connection errors  ad blockers   and differences between ad server spam filtering techniques  The widespread acceptance of discrepancies  across the industry  however  is exploited through fraudulent tampering of metrics and misreporting  impressions   Using state channels  an advanced technique which allows for secure off chain transactions that are  instant  private  and cost zero gas  impression events can be synchronized between peers in real time   eliminating a category of fraud  The state channel implementation to track impressions has already been  prototyped and the code and documentation is on GitHub here    https   github com adChain AdMarket  Once deployed  this will be the first production ready state  channel implementation  and it will be operating at web scale  with the ability to process billions of  impressions per day  secured by smart contracts on Ethereum   Micropayments and a True Three  Sided Advertising Market  As described above  the first AdMarket implementation will primarily be used for accounting  the actual  payments will happen out of band through traditional bank transfers  In time  the AdMarket state  channel implementation will transition to a true micropayments system  In this system  advertisers will pay  publishers tiny amounts on every cleared impression  to be settled periodically on chain    Through Ethereum wallet browser extensions such as MetaMask  users will also be able to participate in  the market for their attention by automatically paying the publishers of the websites they visit the fair

process  of  creating  a  digital  tok en  in  accordance  with the  technology of smart contracts  which is based on  a specific underlying asset   Tokenization  is the  process  of  transforming  the  storage  and  management  of  an  asset   wherein  each  asset is given a corresponding digital  double    An  Underlying  Asset   an  asset   on  which  the  derivative  financial  instrument

protocol version          A Derivative   a contract  by which the parties receive the right or commit to carry   out  some  actions  in  regards  to  an  underlying  asset   Usually   opportunities  to  buy   sell   provide   obtain  certain  goods  or  stocks  are  envisaged   In  contrast  to  a  direct  Sale  and Purchase Agreement  a derivative is formal and standard  initially providing a possibility  for at least one of the parties to freely sell this contract  The price of a derivative and the  character of its changes are closely related to the price of  the underlying asset    The  Token  Holder  or  the  Investor   any  person  or  user  of  blockchain  that  has  received tokens created via using the PATS protocol directly from the protocol developer  or from other former

over tokenized assets    After completing the project selection stage OnPlace legislates legal preparations  and  develops  an  agreement   wi thin  the  limits  of  which  property  rights  over a part  of  private company shares  an underlying asset of a token  are transferred to future holders  of the created tokens    The implementation of protocol tokenization is designed to solve a set of difficulties  arising in the classical scheme of venture investment       A high input threshold for most investors      High transactional costs for processing  deals      The lack of  complete

tokenization of underlying assets included in MOW  We have developed PATS  Private Assets Tokenization System  protocol  which will  allow the community of investors to make decisions in a decentralized manner in regards  to  the  further  distribution  and  motion  of  tokenized  assets   The  use  of  the  protocol  wil l  mean that each decision  in connection to transactions over tokens will be recorded in a  network with its own blockchain and will not be subject to change    To  solve  the  problem  of  commissioning  closed  assets  into  circulation   shares  of  private companies  in stock turnover  we use Ethereum solutions  which allow the creation  of personal units of account in blockchain and contracts for managing them   Every underlying asset implemented using PATS protocol will be represented by a  separate  private  token  and  endowed  logic  of  decentralized  management  of  PATS  protocol    This  approach is  based  on  the  idea  of  creating  a  Decentralized  Autonomous  Organization   in  which  each  holder  of  a  token  is  able  to  directly  affect the  asset  and  determine  further  operations  over  tokens  via  voting   Thus   each  decision  in  regards  to  operating over tokens will be registered in a network and will not be subject to change   Together  with the managing  and  monitoring  functions   PATS  protocol  provides  autonomous  safety of  investors   balances  from  losing  funds  during  the  emission  and  closing of shares     Basic PATS functions allow the investor  the holder of tokens issued on the  basis of  the protocol  to      Determine the closing date of an asset     Add new assets for examination     Vote for the emission of tokens of underlying assets   change the parameters of  circulating

and gambling industry has been constantly plagued with accusations of fraud and cheating by both players and system administrators  In the United States alone  over a dozen online gaming sites have either gone bankrupt or been forcefully shut down by authorities since       resulting in tens of millions of dollars in deposits that have yet to be returned to players  Despite these setbacks  the industry continues to grow  and players continue to risk depositing their funds into centrally owned and operated gaming websites   Provably fair online gaming is badly needed  Enter Peerplays  a solution for provably fair blockchain based gaming that allows users to design their own specialized tokens or chips  buy or sell gateway tokens for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether and then wager these tokens in on chain games   There is no  house  in Peerplays  but instead players are matched with other users for peer to peer gameplay through a series of smart contracts  These contracts escrow the funds wagered by each player and then release them to the winner after specific conditions within a game are met and verified  Smart contracts are built directly into the native blockchain code rather than a virtual scripting machine  which makes transaction processing fast enough to enable millions of players to interact almost simultaneously       Table of Contents     Introduction  Blockchain Consensus  Native Smart Contracts  Provably Fair Gaming  Profit Sharing  Fee distribution Flowchart  Mega Jackpots and PowerUp Points  Open Source GUI  Trustless Asset Exchange  Wagering  Hosted  Public  Client Portals  Server Side Tournament Hosting  Conclusion  References      Introduction  A Peer to Peer Marketplace is an online exchange that brings people and or businesses together to deal with each other directly without having to go through traditional slow and expensive multi party networks  In these marketplaces  motivated individuals with resources and specific skills or talents can simply connect with willing customers through a  rd party  dispatch  service  consisting of either an online platform or mobile app to facilitate a commercial exchange of goods or services and payment between the buyer and seller  Airbnb  eBay  Etsy  Freelancer  Kickstarter  Mr  Delivery  and Uber are examples of the most successful of Peer to Peer networking models today   With the advent of blockchain technologies  and specifically the platform called Graphene it is now possible to launch a peer to peer dispatch service that runs almost entirely on its own  Graphene is an open source  MIT licensed  decentralized blockchain technology that utilizes a Delegated Proof of Stake  DPoS  consensus mechanism  which leverages the power of stakeholder voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way  Commercial interactions between users facilitated by Graphene are cheaper and faster than a traditional company due to greatly reduced overhead costs  while membership and operational criteria is still flexible enough to grow and adapt through a democratic process   Even better  all actions on the blockchain are publicly accessible for audit and verification  eliminating the possibility of cheating  And since decentralized blockchains cannot easily be turned off or shut down by external agencies  blockchain based companies may be among the first organizations in history to enjoy complete global autonomy  This has recently sparked a worldwide movement to promote and explore blockchain technologies as a potential catalyst for new social  political  cooperative  and for profit business models   One such model addressed by Peerplays is the creation of a provably fair and auditable gaming platform  because the online betting and gambling industry has been constantly plagued with accusations of fraud and cheating by both players and system administrators   Peerplays also offers an alternative for payment processing of wagers  as the current legacy system often involves complex legal compliance hurdles which have to be dealt with separately in each country of operation   If payment processing can be outsourced to a decentralized blockchain   rd party gaming partners can unburden themselves in ways that lower the barrier to entry into the marketplace       Blockchain Consensus  Graphene  the technology behind Peerplays  is the same platform used by BitShares  Steem  and Muse  It currently offers the fastest block production times and the highest throughput of any decentralized blockchain consensus mechanism available   supporting   second blocks and a potential throughput capacity of over         transactions per second  On a Graphene based blockchain  stakeholders elect trusted signing  witnesses   and a periodic  randomly chosen deterministic block signing order allows each witness to know when their turn to sign is approaching  Thus  block production speed is only limited by the bandwidth capacity of the signing nodes and the speed of light   which is about   second for a packet to circle the globe   meaning a high bandwidth network could achieve about   second average block times   The high throughput capacity of a Graphene based blockchain is due to a number of architectural specifications modelled after the LMAX  online FX trading  exchange  which has achieved upwards of   million transactions per second  TPS    Some of these highly streamlined design parameters include the limiting of the core business logic to a single thread  the removing of cryptographic operations  hashes and signatures  from the core business logic  the division of validation into state dependent and state independent checks  the use of an object oriented data model  and keeping databases memory resident    Adding new features to a Graphene blockchain requires stakeholder approval  but this process is a largely seamless experience for users because most will use the lightweight or hosted clients  and only full nodes are required to upgrade  On the BitShares network  for example  hard forks usually take a few hours and disruption for most users is minimal to none                              Native Smart Contracts  Here is what Daniel Larimer  lead developer for Graphene  says about running Smart Contracts on Graphene   The BitShares Decentralized Asset Exchange uses an order matching algorithm which is a wonderful example of one such  natively supported  smart contract    This  feature allows buy and sell orders between users to be filled instantly and has been proven in stress tests to handle thousands of unique transactions per second   Furthermore  we can use the analogy of  opening and filling orders  within a marketplace to describe Peerplays player matching   the operation through which players interact with one another using the gaming tournament smart contracts   To begin the process  each player opens an  order  which is then accepted and  filled  by the appropriate on chain smart contract  The smart contract then matches pairs or groups of players together  arbitrates the terms and rules of the game between players and releases the funds to the winner  We have coined the term Peerplays Marketplaceto describe this feature   Step    A Player opens broadcasts an Offer to Contract  henceforth referred to as OTC  into the Peerplays Marketplace  Each OTC contains the appropriate funds to buy in to the desired game  as well as other data required to define the terms in which he wishes to engage in the desired game or tournament   Step   OTCs are matched by a player matching  order matching  algorithm       Step    After players are matched  game play begins and players voluntarily interact  compete  with each other to fulfill the conditions set forth by the rules of the particular game or tournament and their agreement with the Smart Contract   Step    Funds are unlocked by the Smart Contract and sent to the winner  minus any fees which the blockchain automatically distributes to the appropriate places via profit sharing  section      Additionally  an essential element for most games on Peerplays includes the on chain Random Number Generator  RNG  and shuffle program which can generate numbers which are then encrypted to a player s private public key pairing and published on the blockchain  Players are then able to publish or reveal blinded cryptographic signatures to  prove  their positions or holdings in the game  and fast and reliable block times means they can do so with the speed and frequency necessary to facilitate real time gameplay for on chain casino card games  popular board games  and other games of skill   Provably Fair Gaming  Peerplays is a universally auditable platform  All smart contracts are written in open source code  so it is easy to verify that they are functioning as advertised  By broadcasting an OTC  each player essentially enters into an  arbitration agreement  with the blockchain  after which time their only recourse is to follow the rules  The release of escrowed funds is always dependent on voluntary moves  or lack thereof  on the part of each player  so failure to perform these actions in a timely manner  or failure to produce the  winning hand  automatically removes a player s eligibility to receive the jackpot payout   By way of explanation  let us create a hypothetical game called High Card  Here are the rules of this game   Two players place an initial wager  ante   and then each is dealt a single card from a    card deck  After each player looks at her card  a round of betting ensues  or either player can fold  If both remain  then each reveals their card and the highest card wins   Note  suits would also have to be ranked from high to low  for example diamonds low  then clubs  then hearts  and then spades high    To play this game on Peerplays  each player opens an OTC for the game which includes the appropriate ante  After they are matched  the smart contract locks up their funds and the RNG      deals each of them a card  face down    meaning each player s card is published on the blockchain but encrypted to their private public key pair   Then  they are each be able to view their individual cards without revealing it to the other  and make their decisions on whether to bet or fold  Betting involves sending additional funds to the smart contract to escrow  If either player folds  then the smart contract releases the funds to the other player  If one bets and the other calls  or if both pass on the round of betting  then it is time to reveal the cards   To do this  each user must publish the decrypted version of their secret  which can then be proved to be equal to the encrypted version by re encrypting it with their public key  This  proof  is validated automatically by the blockchain code when the user publishes the decrypted version  The smart contract then awards the funds to the player with the higher card  If either player fails to reveal their proof within a certain time limit  they automatically forfeit the jackpot   At launch  Peerplays will allow players to choose single elimination tournament brackets which facilitate multi player tournaments by pairing off players in head to head competition through a series of rounds  The randomized player matching algorithm will prevent or greatly reduce the ability for players to collude  and individual head to head games are not subject to collusion in the same way as multi player tables   These are just a few of the basic tools and features which will be available on Peerplays  Using only these functions we have outlined here  an almost unlimited variety of on chain games can be written and implemented   Profit Sharing  The Peerplays network earns revenue from various operations like the creation and trading of digital asset tokens by users  and the performance of certain custom operations  but most notably from the rake   which is a percentage of each jackpot deducted as a fee  This model allows the network to financially benefit from the trustless arbitration of each tournament and thus prevents Peerplays from having to act as a  house  and bet against its users   Every time a fee is collected  the blockchain automatically splits it into a virtual account governed by a smart contract which distributes the fees in three directions  The largest percentage is distributed at regular intervals into the accounts of Peerplays core token holders as profit sharing  This means that core token holders receive a portion of every jackpot paid in any of the certified wagering instruments  along with a portion of the rest of the      network fees  Another term for the core tokens is Fee Backed Assets or FBAs  because they entitle the holder to a portion of the fees collected by the network  The next portion is directed towards blockchain maintenance  such as for paying block producers and fixing bugs  And the third portion is sent to the Mega Jackpot virtual accumulation account  outlined in the next section   All of these fees and percentages are determined by the elected Peerplays Committee members  who are voted for by the Peerplays token holders   The flowchart below explains how player s fees are distributed   Note  Hosted clients never have control over players funds  they merely offer an  access point  into Peerplays   Mega Jackpots and PowerUp Points  Mega Jackpot tournaments are a way for the Peerplays network to occasionally become the sponsor of large tournament jackpots by utilizing the network s unique  profit sharing  capabilities  Peerplays automatically allocates a small percentage of every network fee into a smart contract secured virtual account called the Mega Jackpot Fund This smart contract then automatically schedules and hosts Mega Jackpot tournament events  and the funds are unlocked and instantly transferred to the tournament winners   PowerUp points are the user reward tokens of the Peerplays network  and are distributed according to win loss records and amounts wagered  among other factors  PowerUp is the only token accepted as the buy in fee for Mega Jackpot tournaments  so they will be in high demand during Mega Jackpot sign up periods  They are tradeable on the asset exchange  and      players can use them for purchases  rewards  or include them in sponsored Jackpot pools for their own Custom tournaments   Open Source GUI  All the operations for regular gameplay on Peerplays will be integrated into a basic open source  Graphic User Interface  GUI  for a seamless user experience  This GUI will be published and  maintained   exposing  all  the basic blockchain functions including simple tools for players to  create their own buy in games  organize and host multi player tournaments  and buy  sell and  create tokens  It will also support live gameplay for all on chain games  The user interface will  be translated into several languages  and will have a modified BSD licence for both personal  and commercial use          Trustless Asset Exchange  As a Graphene Blockchain  Peerplays has the same asset creation and exchange features as BitShares    enabling  users to create their own tokens  and place buy and sell orders on the internal market which are filled by the on chain order matching smart contract  They can also transfer  buy and sell gateway tokens for popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH and price stable SmartCoins from the BitShares platform from a growing number of reputable gateway services  Players can even provide their own profitable gateway services by buying and selling in game assets for popular RPGs   Wagering  The Peerplays tournament smart contract accepts any user issued token for wagering  but charges a small fee if the tokens are not one of the certified wagering instruments  These instruments are chosen in accordance with standards of acceptable value as determined by the committee  Certified instruments charge a rake fee in place of the standard registration fee  which is automatically distributed as part of the profit sharing program  Users can also place wagers with the Peerplays core token   Hosted  Public  Client Portals  Hosted client portals are a way for users to access the Peerplays blockchain through their web browser    while their private keys are stored locally  They are more convenient than private desktop clients  but like most cryptocurrency wallets they require backups to prevent       accidental loss of funds  Private desktop client portals operate much like lightweight wallets that do not require the user to download a full node  but instead reference a series of trusted public nodes  For the highest level of security  users can also run their own full node in conjunction with the desktop client   Operating a public hosted client portal is an opportunity for businesses to make extra income through the referral program or by building and connecting an independent  rd party website to organize and host their own server side tournaments   Server Side Tournament Hosting  Server side game hosting is still a trusted and proven model in the eSports industry  and has seen explosive growth in the past   years  Peerplays supports optional server side hosting of games while offering a variety of tools for business enhancement  For example  simply connecting to Peerplays through the API allows anyone to utilize the decentralized network for processing of wagers and jackpots while continuing to operate an independent website  Peerplays  customizable tournament management smart contract lets any game publisher  advertiser  tournament host or vendor create their own tournament structures  fee schedules  and wager collection   distribution methods for any off chain  server hosted  game in the world  And gaming partners can offer additional benefits and perks to users by designing their own custom GUI or even by simply hosting the basic open source Peerplays GUI on a public server   Peerplays also has a blockchain guaranteed referral program which automatically pays a percentage of lifetime revenue for each new player referred to the network  which means businesses can earn major  kickbacks  by plugging into Peerplays and getting all their existing users to sign up for a Peerplays account   Conclusion  Peerplays offers a unique value proposition to both end users and existing businesses  By combining provably fair gaming with a decentralized blockchain based wagering  Peerplays effectively tackles several key industry challenges while offering strong incentives for existing gaming platforms to integrate  Overall  the platform is well equipped for future growth and adaptation to changing market conditions due to its next generation voting and consensus mechanisms  and is strongly positioned to become the premiere go to provider for blockchain based solutions in the online gaming industry        References       http   www pokersites com defunct             http   www gamblingsites com online gambling jurisdictions             https   bitshares
