You want to evaluate model accuracy after establishing a model with the sentiment score for the review obtained using the sentiment dictionary(lexicon) as an independent variable. Among the entire data, only the first 1000 data are used for convenience. Among these, the first 70% is used as train data to build a model, and the remaining 30% is used as test data to evaluate accuracy. For accuracy evaluation, accuracy ( accuracy rate) is used."
